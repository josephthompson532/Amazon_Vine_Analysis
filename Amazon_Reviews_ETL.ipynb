    "This notebook shows you how to create and query a table or DataFrame loaded from data stored in AWS S3. There are two ways to establish access to S3: [IAM roles](https://docs.databricks.com/user-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/iam-roles.html) and access keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "*We recommend using IAM roles to specify which cluster can access which buckets. Keys can show up in logs and table metadata and are therefore fundamentally insecure.* If you do use keys, you'll have to escape the `/` in your keys with `%2F`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **Python** notebook so the default cell type is Python. However, you can use different languages by using the `%LANGUAGE` magic command. Python, Scala, SQL, and R are all supported."

The automatic autherntication does not work and the offline setup doesn't either. The super secret code it generates does nothing. You copy that to one window then type in the other super secret code that comes on the back of a book, hit authenticate or whatever and it terminates, saying you should make sure the unlock request is entered correctly. Well, yes you idiots, I know how to copy and paste. You cannot play even offline and you have to start all over again. There is a securerom link to go to if you can't get it working. It doesn't work either. It's so secure you can't access it. I do have the xbox version so I can play it but I prefer PC gaming.<br /><br />Maybe the steam version is the way to go. I haven't tried it and am not planning to buy the damn thing a third time but that might be the way to go instead of footling around with the disc version. I do not recommend wasting your time trying to get through Rockstar's DRM. Honestly you idiots, pirates will pirate. Regular users are the ones who get scred by DRM.

As for the USB ports, you connect a USB lead from the stand to one of the open ports on your PS4, this gives you one open port on the PS4 and 3 USB ports on the stand itself. Also if you have the PS4 settings in Rest Mode it will automatically shut down the fans when it turns off power to the USB ports.

Some of the intensity of hockey is lost on TV, the relaxation of watching a baseball game on a nice day surpasses sitting in the living room. But sometimes the commentary adds a lot to the game. A bit of context, some history, something you wouldn’t get being at the game itself.<br /><br /> I’ve played, and enjoyed, each of the Batman Arkham games that have come out. Arkham Knight is no different. It has an open world to explore, the same melee style combat and stealth action as previous games. There are a few additions to the game. A heavy dose of Batmobile, an overhaul of the game world into utter chaos, a new hierarchy of villains and a more involved cast of supporting characters. It’s the same style game revamped, and a little darker than previous installments.<br /><br /> The game picks up with the death of the Joker from Arkham Origins. It’s Halloween of the following year and after a threat to the city everyone but the police force evacuates as gangs and militia take over. The primary adversary through the game is the Arkham Knight, a militaristic, unknown villain who leads a mercenary army into Gotham under the direction of Scarecrow who is trying to release a massive dose of fear gas into the city.<br /><br /> There are two big additions to the game. The well-advertised, and a bit controversial Batmobile which can be switched between a high powered sports car and a tank. While the tank combat is enjoyable, though fairly easy since enemies telegraph their attacks, the heavy reliance on the Batmobile can become cumbersome. Flying from rooftop to rooftop is both enjoyable and quicker than driving through Gotham’s winding streets most of the time, but there are numerous sections of the game where the Batmobile is shoe-horned into the gameplay. Open up an area, go back for the Batmobile to open up the next section, rinse and repeat. While the car adds some nice variety to the game it can act like an anchor, slowing down gameplay by making you use it. The other big addition to the game is the Joker as a supporting character. This, to me, is the more enjoyable of the additions though it doesn’t really add anything to the gameplay. Through events in the game the Joker becomes part of Batman’s psyche, visible and audible to Batman, but no one else. He provides commentary on events and pokes at Batman’s actions. While the games are fun of their own right, the color commentary really adds something special to the game. It provides greater context of the events and humor in an otherwise serious game.<br /><br /> The world is very similar to the past two installments in the series, Arkham City and Arkham Origins, a sprawling cityscape of Gotham. The game takes place over the course of a single night so it’s always dark and raining from beginning to end. The main difference in the world is that the city has erupted into utter chaos. In the previous games gangs roved the city, but Arkham Knight takes it to another level as a militarized force has moved into the city alongside the normal array of gangs filling the city streets and making it more likely to run into a fight going from point A to point B.<br /><br /> The normal array of hand to hand combat and stealth carries over from the previous games. You swing from rafter to rafter or crawl through ducts taking out enemies one by one silently until you burst out, or the more likely scenario for me is being seen, for hand to hand combat. The same array of gadgets are available to you as previous games in the series, the bat claw, the disruptor for turning off weapons, smoke pellets, you get the idea, with a few new additions like a voice modulator, which really just put up more walls to progression that you unlock through the story. There is a new fear take down mechanism that allows you to do multiple takedowns in a short period, along with a series of new automated enemies such as drones you can hack and automatic turrets you must avoid. As mentioned before the Batmobile is now playable and there is a good amount of tank combat which is nimble and enjoyable. You steer the Batmobile which is able to move in all directions quickly, while you combat automated tanks which telegraph their attacks with light beams that change color when they have a lock. It makes the combat a bit simplistic, but it’s a nice change of pace from the normal melee combat you usually encounter in the games.<br /><br /> The graphics look great. The city is dark and ominous. The characters are well rendered and the voice acting is still superb. The main complaint I have with the presentation is there are times where Batman’s mouth doesn’t move while speaking.<br /><br /> There is a ton of side content, but it can be a little annoying. While the content itself is well-done, it involves finding it. Sometimes radio banter will alert you to where the event is, but even with that it can be difficult to locate at times. It would be nice if once you get a clue as to where the content is it would mark it, but it doesn’t. Sometimes I would hear some banter that would alert me. I would fly in the direction indicated but not see where the event was and there wouldn’t be any more banter.<br /><br /> Arkham Knight is a great game in its own right. It’s another high-quality installment in a great series. But the addition of the Joker to provide commentary really puts things over the top. It may not actually add anything to the gameplay, but getting a glimpse at Batman’s thoughts and insecurities is a great added bonus to the game. The commentary may not be a focal point, it may not be something any focused on, but it really adds something to the game. It can help fill in the gaps, it can help bring things alive, it can help give a glimpse at something I wouldn’t have been able to see otherwise. It also makes up for some of the short comings that have arisen with the new mechanics. The additional barriers to progression you have to unlock, having to hunt down side content or the sometimes overzealous use of the Batmobile.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>52523690</td><td>R324W4LBPBB7G</td><td>B00RYGM48E</td><td>584401258</td><td>Disk Warrior 5 - Mac (select) Version 5 Edition</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Brought my mac back to life!

With each release, Disney manages to stuff their game with so many things to do, and 3.0 takes this further with a mind-boggling amount of content to tackle.  Long after many AAA hardcore games are completed, Disney Infinity will keep chugging along with something new to find. Having Star Wars to bring in their latest series was a no-brainer for Disney - and everyone predicted it would happen.  I'm happy to say, Disney went into overdrive with this release as they have done the Star Wars license mighty justice.  The gameplay is spot on this time with fun quests and tons of side missions. Unlike the previous Marvel Super Heroes, Star Wars's missions vary from ground  to space, keeping the adventures fresh at all time. The combat is highly improved with spectacular moves that are more complex and satisfying. I mean, come on - lightsabers? That's all you need to know.  Both Twilight of the Republic and Rise against the Empire are equally enjoyable, and even after completion, you'll be back to revisit and will find much more to do.<br /><br />Back on Earth, without even firing up one of the Star Wars Playsets, you'll find an overwhelming amount to explore, thanks to the Toy Hub (not to be confused with the Toy Box). The Hub is the center for everything.  It's segmented like a pie, with one section for racing, another combat, platforming, etc.. Each section has an intro level and sub levels that you can play which introduce you to the game's mechanics. It's brilliantly put together. One particular area host a farming simulator for your sidekicks. Oh, sidekicks are mini-sized Disney characters that hang with you during your questing. They can be told to follow and fight along, or farm for vegetables and other surprises. As your crops grow, you can feed your sidekicks to increase their stats. Better stats equals more abilities like cooler weapons, and other interesting gear. It really adds an RPG feel to the infinity series, and those little folk are pretty kick butt in battle! When I first heard about farming being added to the series, I was scratching my head, but from what I heard, people are spending hours just in that section alone!<br /><br />The Disney Main Street area of the hub is a sight to behold, and it's here where you can stop at Flynn's Arcade (of Tron fame) to jump into some on-line multiplayer games, or hang out at the El Capitan theater and play community levels, or even watch videos based around the game. Trust me when I say, the Hub is going to keep you real busy.  And finally, there's the Toybox, the heart of the Disney Infinity empire.This time around, the ToyBox has received a lot of new gadgets and scenery, so expect an abundance of community levels that utilize the new features.<br /><br />Besides the two Star Wars PlaySets, there is currently a third which is based on Pixar's awesome animated movie,  Inside Out. This takes a different approach than the other sets, as it brings pure 2D/3D platforming bliss to the table, and dazzling it is!  Then there are the two expansion games. Unlike the playsets, which come with characters and an adventure crystal, these expansions are just a special single disc. When dropped on the portal, they add an all new game to the already massive mix; currently, there are two:  Toybox Takeover which is a dungeon crawler where any Disney/Marvel/Star Wars Character can quest , and the highly touted DI Speedway, which is a Mario Kart-like racing game. All these sets unlock even more toys to add to the already massive selection in the Toybox.  Oh, and if that wasn't enough, there's more DI goodness coming down the pike later later this year,  including a new playset based on the upcoming, highly anticipated movie in the Star Wars saga,  The Force Awakens, and an all out brawl fest titled Marvel Battlegrounds which will support four player combat.<br /><br />With all the excellence that is 3.0, there are a few things that I feel need attention:<br /><br />- Saving a game on the Disney Cloud using the PS4 is still super slow. I'm not sure how is is on other formats.<br />- Some of the tools in the Toybox I thought would have made the jump to light speed like the rest of the game, instead, they remain the same, like the yellow trigger cube which is cumbersome to resize.<br />- The Toybox still restricts certain actions to a certain type of toy. For example, if you want a particular object to be &#34;collectible&#34; in a quest, you can only use what the developers chose as a collectible item. At least there's a better selection than last year.<br />- This year's amazing new path creator is great for making objects follow an assigned path. It will surely take community games to a whole new level. The first thing that came to my mind when I read about the Path Tool's capabilities was ROLLERCOASTERS! Well, turns out - there's no coaster track,  train track, or even a coaster car. There are coaster sounds effects, though? Odd, right?<br /><br />In closing, there are so many features with Disney Infinity 3,0, it would be painful to have to write a review and list them all. Whether you're 6 or 65, you're in for one of the big gaming treats of 2015.brawl fest titled Marvel Battlegrounds which will support four player combat.

If you can look past all of that you then have the constant fear that the game will crash, and you WILL not get through a play through without it crashing, you just have to hope you don't lose a character and have to start all over (that one happened to me... Thanks lionhead). For some positives the story is ok and the characters are engaging enough to hold your attention.

Our Playstation gets used constantly in our house and it seems like we could never have enough controllers charged since the console is only able to charge 2 of them at a time.<br /><br />Having this has made a huge difference, now we always make sure to have controllers charging on this station in addition to the 2 that charge directly from the console. I love that this can be plugged in anywhere using a USB adapter.<br /><br />The charging station seems to charge the controllers pretty quickly and puts on a near little LED light show while doing it. I do have to admit that it is pretty fun to watch light up in the evenings, the kids think it is really cool as well. I received one to review and it has been getting a ton of use around our household.

When you exit out of the game, you can go right back in and pick up where you left off.  Well if you turn off your Xbox and come back a day later, you will try to pick up where you left off and find that it just says loading and never logs into the EA servers.  I found that I would have to start another game and eject the Madden disc and log out.  Then put the Madden 16 disk in and let it load.  It would load from the beginning and work right away and the kinect would log me back into my account.  I only have to do this for Madden.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>13720995</td><td>R1A2EDL0UIISKP</td><td>B005HN5LKY</td><td>148114874</td><td>Gen AC Adapter Power Supply Cord for Xbox 360 Slim</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>This one works great.</td><td>My old one was having some serious issues.

Now, as far as the &#34;feel&#34; of a controller in my hands, this is hands down, the VERY best of them all!  The feel, the look, the touch screen on top.  Everything works perfectly to give you that great gaming experience.  However, when it comes to the components that make up the insides of the controller?!  Well, that's a completely different thing.  The trigger buttons are plastic and when you get to shooting those bad guys, well, the plastic tends to tear apart.  This happened to me while playing [[ASIN:B00SHXKC8M Borderlands: The Handsome Collection - Playstation 4]].  I played through the original Borderlands, the 2nd, and even the 3rd (prequel) on my Xbox 360, MULTIPLE times, without having a problem.  However, only a few hours into this game, the trigger pin shattered, leaving me without a gun in the middle of Pandora?!<br /><br />Apparently, this is a rather common problem as you'll find countless videos about it on Youtube.  Do yourself a favor and go purchase R2 & L2 replacement buttons from eBay.  That way if you do find yourself with a broken controller, you can fix it right up.  And it is rather easy to fix.  So that's definitely a good thing!</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>19833226</td><td>RDG33PWYEF0O9</td><td>B001GIUWX0</td><td>5718629</td><td>Mario Kart Wii</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>best game for the family</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>34170274</td><td>R127WEQY2FM1T3</td><td>B00W435BU0</td><td>487294121</td><td>Madden NFL 16</td><td>Video Games</td><td>1</td><td>147</td><td>175</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Hot Mess. Don't Buy.</td><td>This is an absolute hot mess.  EA has become infatuated with selling virtual football cards for hundreds of dollars and gimmicky drafts with dead  and retired football players on Ultimate Teams, and in the process has destroyed the core game.<br /><br />CFM mode fantasy draft is virtually useless.  You are unable to sort by categories and higher overall rated players are rated less than the mysterious rating placed upon players by EA.  This is worse than the so called perfect players.  I am a JJ Watt fan but 99 in all categories? This is getting ridiculous.  They've changed things that didn't need changing.  Some VP at EA must've had their 12 year old nephew rate the players.<br /><br />They are so enamored with one handed catches by receivers that the rest of the game doesn't work.<br /><br />Case in point.<br /><br />Just played game with Eli Manning after CFM fantasy draft.  On 2nd and three Manning throws a 27 yard pass to Avant who catches and runs for 8 more yards.  After great fanfare by Sims and company, the game cycles to the next play and its mysteriously 3rd and ten and the announcers are talking about how terrible the offense has been playing.<br /><br />Later in the fourth quarter my DB intercepts a pass on the 1 yard line.  Next play Manning takes the snap to throw from the end zone.  The line holds, no one in the backfield.  The play freezes and it says its a safety, and wants me to punt.  Manning is standing there holding the ball.<br /><br />Continually you select a play and when you go to choose a hot route, not only does the art disappear.  But the play that starts is not one you've selected, and its not even in your list of audibles.  The tight ends disappear.  This is the worst Madden ever.<br /><br />This  list  of wierdness could go on forever.  Don't buy it.  Go back to Madden 15 until they fix it.. Maybe 2 years from now.  These are not small glitches.  These are major problems.  It is totally unplayable.<br /><br />EA thinks that eye candyand one handed catches can distract you enough to realize that you can't even play the game.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>2260982</td><td>R3JR5OVDJ1CEGC</td><td>B00EEMLMW0</td><td>729173503</td><td>Call of Duty: Ghosts</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Great deal👌🏼👌🏼😁😁</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>50591651</td><td>RIGRG22TJ0AED</td><td>B00ZMBLKPG</td><td>966892383</td><td>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition - Xbox One</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>2</td><td>2</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Click Click Boom!

Strangely, it is missing &#34;Portable Ops&#34; which introduced the whole comrade system used in Peacewalker and MGSV.

First off, the base is well made and looks good on a table. The characters are incredibly detailed and are worth it even if you don't own Disney Infinity. You can set the difficulty of the game so kids and adults can enjoy it. I love the whole atmosphere of the game and the creation aspect since you can do pretty much anything you want to do.<br /><br />If you have a Disney Infinity game already then I suggest not upgrading to 3.0 until you get a next gen console. This game is getting quite big and if you want to build bigger worlds and enjoy smoother gameplay then get it when you get a next gen console. This upcoming black friday would be a great time since this game would probably drop a lot and so will consoles.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>32694340</td><td>R6HWCDWZB1LM5</td><td>B00N4OAELY</td><td>272196441</td><td>Nintendo Wii Remote Plus</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>I love it</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>24080866</td><td>R3AOBXT2X6P117</td><td>B00U33Q940</td><td>607192535</td><td>NVIDIA SHIELD - 4K HDR Streaming Media Player.

Unfortunately it isn't as ambitious as it could be.  While I enjoyed my time and recommend it to others, the choices you make only affect what may or may not happen to a character, but not the overall story.  This was what I found to be disappointing.  Some main characters, no matter what decisions you make, will always be in the final chapter.  Only then can you decide if they live or die.  I won't necessarily say I felt deceived, but played instead.<br /><br />The game said I can choose who to save or let die.  While that's true, the game sells itself short by not letting players ultimately decide when and where it can necessarily happen.  The game uses a butterfly effect system that notifies players when future events have been altered by the choices they just made.  This system could have been more revolutionary if the game wasn't so restricted with its storytelling.<br /><br />The most simplest way I can explain this is that each character, besides the main ones, are being strung along for the ride.  They each have their particular moments for them and them alone.  It's the player's job to make sure they get there by not cutting the cord with the decisions they make or don't make at a designated time.  Ultimately, the game has a story to tell and will tell it regardless if you want to play along or not.<br /><br />This game and future games like it can improve by allowing some deviation from the main plot.  Even letting players choose the blue pill (Matrix reference).  If Neo takes it, there is no story or film.  For example, I wouldn't mind if I played the game in a way everyone died within the first couple of hours and it was game over.  Characters shouldn't have their set paths unless we can decide how they get there.  This is ultimately where I would like this genre to go.  If it doesn't, we're just being pulled along as well.eady been written by the choices you made prior.&#34;  You can see the pros and cons to this, but ultimately the decision made by the developers encourages more replay-ability.  Normally I would frown upon this, but the game isn't that long.  It's about 8-10 hours depending how much you explore.  It's split up in to chapters so a replay isn't much of a chore.  All you have to do is put up with the unskippable cutscenes, but the acting is well done and you can make certain changes to them with the choices you make.  All in all, this game was better than I thought.  I was expecting another The Order, but having an interactive experience with good characters in an overall fun story.  The game is definitely worth your time.  Controls leave more to be desired, but games like this are a good alternative to the norm and leave hope for more old school style Survival Horror games.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>1694477</td><td>R3PR2S8R1DG23Q</td><td>B00009WNZA</td><td>171514791</td><td>The Sims 2</td><td>Video Games</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>2</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>One Star</td><td>When i tried to install this my registration code was invalid, which means it was already used???!!!!</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>20446607</td><td>RX0MIN8UKJL9Y</td><td>B00QU506JY</td><td>829142266</td><td>Skylanders Trap Team: Midnight Museum Dark Element Expansion Pack</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>birthday gift</td><td>gift for grandson and he requested it so he loved it.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>1002859</td><td>R1U4ZFH3CPS7XF</td><td>B00WZTZY2S</td><td>74218589</td><td>Pokemon Pokeball Pikachu Special Edition Video Game Vinyl Decal Skin Sticker Cover for the New Nintendo 3DS XL LL 2015 System Console</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>goood</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>35703201</td><td>R2RZKHAEDNDKGM</td><td>B001GPEHEI</td><td>463596690</td><td>Playstation 3 WarBeast Guitar</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>awsome buy</td><td>loved this product no lag nice build and button lay out is good</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>51627902</td><td>R3FDZ5ZOYTC9NP</td><td>B00AXI9WEE</td><td>79753503</td><td>DISNEY INFINITY Starter Pack</td><td>Video Games</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Awful</td><td>TERRIBLE GAME!!!  when I got it I couldn't believe how terrible the graphics were. this is a reason you should get a wii u.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>52776340</td><td>R2AFJ1A9JQ5C9D</td><td>B00N4OAELY</td><td>272196441</td><td>Nintendo Wii Remote Plus</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Works great</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>2585382</td><td>R2MOE0I34XCATF</td><td>B0001PWIUO</td><td>816418808</td><td>JVC Sega Victor V-Saturn Console</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>It's the model 2 JVC Saturn!</td><td>I've had the model 2 JVC V-Saturn for 11 years now, and basically it's just a Japanese Sega Saturn manufactured by JVC with all of the same features like a normal Sega Saturn from SEGA.

I have it sitting on top of my cabinet and it keeps the PS4 in an upright position perfectly.  It fit the PS4 perfectly, and was an exact fit.  The controllers also go in and fit in perfectly.    There is a slight noise to it, but it is expected, as there is a fan running.  The blue light can get distracting, so you might want to put some electrical tape over it if it is in your line of sight.  The fan comes on automatically when the PS4 is on, and shuts off with the PS4, if you are powering it via the USB port on the PS4.  You can also manually shut if off by pushing the button on the front.    It's well made and does its job.  If you have the space for it, and play a lot, I would recommend investing in one.    *I received this item for free for an unbiased and honest review.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>8649864</td><td>R2BI6JOZCXO61I</td><td>B00000JLQX</td><td>488933896</td><td>Barbie Riding Club - PC</td><td>Video Games</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Very disappointed!</td><td>The game did not work!

This game will keep you as the player engaged from start to finish. As some games like this type lose steam towards the end, Until Dawn keeps steady from start to finish. I beat this twice in 24 hours just because I was drawn into the story.<br /><br />Very impressive with the graphics and the feel. Sometimes the frame rate is quirky in some spots but nothing noticeable to most casual players. While the camera angles do not adjust much, this adds to the appeal and creep factor this game has. Controls make sense as it makes your characters look and react with a sense of reality that applies to this game.<br /><br />The game play itself has a great balance of presenting the story but making sure you are ultimately in control. Tensions grow as you run through areas making sure anticipate your next action, but you cannot over commit as the command may change or speed up. Your choices matter for the most part and are hidden all throughout the game. You don't ALWAYS know what choice you make is that pivotal moment in a characters life and that makes it exciting.<br /><br />So why 4 stars? As much as I love it, I would not spend 60 dollars for this game. I feel its appeal is awesome but will fade after about the 3rd play through. While it would be nice to say I wish this game would be bigger, that's not the case. The design of the game itself just becomes self limiting at points.

I thought I'd never say that again after COD Modern Warfare, but it's true it's true! Gameplay was fun and almost fresh, almost, I really dug the exo suit abilities kinda like TitanFall minus giant robots but with an actual campaign. Controls are tight and responsive and the voice acting was better than I expected, so good in fact my wife actually sat and watched many of the cut scenes and she almost never does that for any game. To recap an immersive story, some of the best graphics on the Xbox 1, good controls, different abilities different feel thanks to the exo suits, good voice acting. Why then only four stars? well I'm glad you asked...I got through the campaign in about 7-8 hrs...on veteran, not too big of a deal i know cod games are all about the multiplayer but I have always played the main campaign before jumping into an online match and, this was one of the easiest campaigns to get through on veteran that I can remember take it as you will it is what it is. Installation although not really a part of the gameplay itself, It is part of the whole experience. Installation from a disc took ver 3 hours not cool, I realize its a large file almost 50 GBs, but come on over 3 hours really? not for a download but rather a simple installation, C'mon?<br />DISCLAIMER: This review is for the main campaign ONLY not the multiplayer. But I will add my two cents for those of you who trash the matchmaking cause you can't prey on the newer or lesser skilled players so you can bolster your stats are you serious!? are you serious!? shame on you, ya'll need to get a life. If you feel you are that good on ANYTHING in life, challenge yourself against like minded and similarly skilled competitors or opponents and stop bitchin' about not being able to take advantage of the COD skill impaired cause that ain't cool and you look petty and childish (unless of course you ARE a child), in which case I would suggest you put forth all that energy and effort on become a better human being rather that a better COD player, again just my two cents...Game on and prosperlife, challenge yourself against like minded and similarly skilled competitors or opponents and stop bitchin' about not being able to take advantage of the COD skill impaired cause that ain't cool and you look petty and childish (unless of course you ARE a child), in which case I would suggest you put forth all that energy and effort on become a better human being rather that a better COD player, again just my two cents...Game on and prosper</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>193950</td><td>R2257UUDN7DIF8</td><td>B0000AHRPN</td><td>18763155</td><td>SpongeBob Squarepants: Battle For Bikini Bottom</td><td>Video Games</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>good delivery bad game</td><td>Great delivery game is meh though I thought it was the one on the GameCube but it's a pixilated piece of garbage still fun to play and great delivery</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>2998930</td><td>R2IOEP7L9O83XV</td><td>B00K1J34IA</td><td>433311435</td><td>HDE White USB Play and Charge Charging Cables for Xbox 360 Wireless Game Controllers</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Excellent purchase.

The build quality is solid, and while upon holding it, the sticks may seem a little stiff and the face buttons a little too... &#34;pushy&#34; (not &#34;clicky&#34; enough?), during gameplay they actually all feel & work perfectly. The only downside is the fault of the Wii U itself, not the controller (you gotta keep the Gamepad on; turning it off means turning off the system).<br /><br />Definitely recommended if you're looking for a good, normal controller for the Wii U and don't want to spend too much. It's definitely better than the Gamepad in feel, and almost as nice as an Xbox 360 or PS4 Dual Shock controller, period.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>51771179</td><td>R2HXSIZT98EJ6D</td><td>B00519C7CE</td><td>638752222</td><td>Call of Duty: Black Ops</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Can't beat it.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>25796024</td><td>R2CHKIITOMKG6O</td><td>B00U33Q940</td><td>607192535</td><td>NVIDIA SHIELD - 4K HDR Streaming Media Player.

But first let's start with the major downside: bugs. The game is buggy, with some rare framerate issues, and as of writing this review there is at least one quest that is unfinishable because of a weird bug (Skellige's Most Wanted), but luckily CD Projekt Red is constantly releasing patches so soon the game will be perfect! Besides this though, I do consider this game perfect. The combat is amazing, and extremely fun, and although it is quite difficult in the beginning, it gets easier. I recommend playing on the &#34;Blood and Broken Bones&#34; difficulty. The graphics, although slightly glitchy at times, are beautiful. The world of the Witcher 3 is one of the most beautiful, and expansive that I have ever seen. This is my first Witcher game, and it is easy to get into, although I do recommend reading the books (I'm currently reading Time of Contempt) because not only are they great, but also will make your gameplay experience that much better. Overall, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is not only the current best game on the Playstation 4, but also one of the best games ever.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>4375040</td><td>R2RQUJDDM7MGIP</td><td>B003UYDOFG</td><td>899579939</td><td>Freshly Picked ~ Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland (European Edition)</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>It's a fun game</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>39691381</td><td>R2NI05DXNFJ45A</td><td>B00ZOMO41A</td><td>649666679</td><td>Animal Crossing Card amiibo [Animal Crossing Series] 5 pack set</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>6</td><td>7</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Great transaction!!</td><td>Exactly as described. 5 packs of Animal Crossing Amiibo cards, containing 3 cards each.

You can play for 30min then the sounds goes completely hay wire. Sounds very very strange and hurts my ears. I had commented on it below. The robotic sounds. Very disappointed. I will never buy anything from turtle beach again they've sold their good name to the Chinese to maximize profits. Shame on them.<br /><br />they disconnect from sound completely and have to be re-paired very often. 2-3 times through 5hrs of playing.<br /><br />Every couple hours they will also sound like a really weird robot electronic sound. Very very strange sounding. Can't play a game at all with it when it does this. Hurts my ears. Again only way to fix is re-pair/sync them, but be prepared to do it often. Not reliable.<br /><br />Max Volume is okay, honestly I think it's 20% lower then my turtle beach X32. And they were as loud as I like anything. These will never hurt your ears on full blast by a long shot. They get loud enough to be okay, but not LOUD.<br /><br />The whole charging thing lol. Yeah they are constantly on when charging. No way to turn that off. Just turning them down is all. So if they are off and you plug them in to charge they will come on and stay on while charging.  Only thing you can do is turn volume down on them. That is a massive engineering mistake. Someone should have their rear end paddeled like a small toddler....then appropriately be fired.<br /><br />The presets are a joke. I mean a real joke. Like the designers were laughing when they saw them being put on a truck and being shipped out. All presets sound very very close tothe same.<br /><br />These are wireless. But holy cow, they suck besides that.<br /><br />If you were to ignore all the negatives (which are way too bad to really ignore... Seriously) they are a 3 out of 5 star headphone.<br /><br />These are cheap Chinese junk. Turtle beach is looking for maximum profits at the consumers expense. It's time to leave turtle beach where they belong. On the curb wearing useless headphones.<br /><br />They used to be pretty good. No more. They are trash.<br /><br />Update...... They just started flashing red and stopped working.... I'm actually not surprised at all.

Now I can put my hand up against the console and it is not hot at all, just slightly warm, which is to be expected for as many hours that it is being used daily.<br /><br />Having the console in the vertical stand also helps free up some space and clear up some of the clutter around the TV, which is nice.

This is one of the best Sonic outings in years.<br /><br />Sonic Boom is a GORGEOUS 2.5D entry in the series that pulls it's characters and settings from the Sonic Boom branch of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. That means it's a sidescroller like classic games, but with 3D graphics - think something like Donkey Kong Country Returns if you haven't heard of the term &#34;2.5D&#34; before. The title incorporates elements from a lot of quality sidescrollers - including world map screens similar to various Mario titles, team based gameplay with unique powers like in The Lost Vikings, expansive maps with hidden paths only accessible with specific skills a la Metroid - and meshes them all with quality Sonic gameplay.<br /><br />If you just play through the stages as fast as you can, you'll enjoy a Sonic game with great level designs that's a little less precise than the best games in the series, but has a focus on tricks & special moves to engage instead of asking for precision all the time. With the characters' new &#34;electro whip&#34; thingie, they can now swing from grapple points, and with their individual abilities, all the platforming becomes something special. You'll end up pulling off combos like run &#62; jump &#62; swing &#62; air dash &#62; slam down into a zip boost &#62; grind &#62; bounce pad &#62; swing, etc. So the classic-ness of the gameplay, while a little less fast and a little less precise, is actually a lot more engaging and rewarding to play. The game does bring the speed though, it's just metered out a little better than in previous sidescrollers. The camera is also a lot better and more dynamic, with a nice amount of &#34;lead space&#34; (the distance between the front of your character and the edge of the screen) so you actually have enough time to see obstacles coming and AVOID them. Crazy!<br /><br />The game is a bit of an &#34;adventure&#34; in that you'll need to return to areas with new characters to gain access to different chunks of the levels and collect different doodads. Collecting doodads is important for a few reasons, namely you need them to access new levels (they're locked and require a certain number of emblems - obtained by finishing the stage, finishing it under a certain amount of time, collecting all the crystal shards in the level, etc. - to unlock), and you need blueprints to get Tails to build you upgrades. These upgrades apply to all characters, and include awesome things like destroying enemies by running through them, revealing item locations on the level map, or adding a &#34;Ring Vaccuum&#34; effect to your character so you can grab them by merely getting close to them, instead of having to get through them. A fully powered up character at the end of the game is a big improvement from one at the beginning, so the upgrades are important. Luckily going back into the levels with new characters and using their abilities are really fun. Tails lets you use fans in the level since he can glide, and he also has a toy submarine that lets you access a mini-game to get things too. Knuckles and bust through certain materials and tunnel underground, and Sticks has a boomerang that you can control around in the air - very useful for anything really, but specifically for hitting switches and turning off traps. Our main man Sonic however can air dash, which gives him the ability to reach out of the way areas (&#34;L shaped&#34; moves; air dashing straight up and right, for instance) and bust through blue blocks. You'll see all these &#34;hooks&#34; while making your way through levels, so you're going to WANT to explore further. And with Tails' upgrades, you won't be wandering around aimlessly - you'll see the items on your level map, know where you need to go, and just have to find the way to get there and pick the character who can do it.<br /><br />The levels are really well designed in general, and - like I said before - gorgeous. This is one game where you'll want to crank the 3D up from time to time, because the depth in the game is really nice. There's a great mix of foreground, mid and background objects and the camera's dynamic; the 3D really makes it look like a diorama with it's mix of depth. All the models & textures look great too - this is one of the nicest looking games on 3DS for sure. It all moves at a smooth clip too. All the worlds are very distinct in aesthetic and feel from one another too. All the levels are built to accommodate both speeding through, with a default &#34;middle track&#34; and exploration, with additional &#34;upper and lower tracks&#34;, to every level. So you'll end up exploring above, below and all over your main track on subsequent playthroughs, but it's always off to the side the speedier stuff - it never gets in the way. They're really good level designs that they function so well just racing through or slowing down and taking your time.<br /><br />Sonic Shattered Crystal is super enjoyable once you come to terms with it's little oddities. Namely how progression works (gotta get those emblems!) and the less-precise-than-other-Sonic-sidescrollers controls (well, that's not true. It's better than Sonic 4 Part 1 and the Sonic Rivals games). It's gorgeous, the elements it adds to Sonic gameplay are fresh and welcome, the way it handles team based skills works beautifully, there's loads of content here, and it's just a blast to play. Highly recommended - but you don't even need to take my word for it. There's a demo for Sonic Boom on the 3DS eShop - just give it a play. This game is rad and deserves a purchase if you enjoy quality sidescrollers and Sonic games. Also, be on the lookout for it's sequel coming up this year: Sonic Boom Fire & Ice. It's from the same developers and looks to be as good as this one while adding in more to the formula.<br /><br />Fun fact; the developers of this are Sanzaru Games. They're also the studio that makes Sly Cooper for Sony now (Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time for PS3/Vita is freakin' fantastic as well, I should point out). Sony only deals in quality platformers - just look at Jak & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank or Ape Escape - so when Sega gets the makers of Sly Cooper to make a Sonic game, you would figure it would be good, right? Well it is. It's an absolute - baffling - shame that so many outlets refused to cover this and instead focus on the disaster of the console game.ike I said before - gorgeous.

This mic does in fact pair with the PS4 when the dongle is used, unlike what is stated in the other review.<br /><br />The problem is that the audio quality is terrible. I don't know whether this is due to the dongle doing a bad job at transmitting and receiving audio, or just the headset itself, but the quality is unbearable. The input/recording quality is pretty bad, but almost tolerable. The output/playback quality is potentially worse than what you would hear out of a cassette player that survived a nuclear fallout that's playing at the other end of a noisy tunnel. It's choppy, cuts in and out, and is just plain awful. Do yourself a favor and do not purchase this mic.<br /><br />Aside from the garbage audio quality, everything else seems OK. The build quality is decent, and it's generally pretty comfortable. It's a shame, I thought I could finally have a wireless chat headset for my PS4, but this one is a significant downgrade from the default mic provided with the PS4, and I'll be returning it.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>31703840</td><td>R3PPZPBI00RQNO</td><td>B0058FN036</td><td>978768906</td><td>New SNES Tomee USB Controller Eight-Way Directional Pad & Six Digital Buttons Works For PC & Mac</td><td>Video Games</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Great controller but the d-pad is just a bit slanted</td><td>Great controller but the d-pad is just a bit slanted.

The sound is below par, I mean it's like going back in time to older WWII shooters. Graphics are probably the worst I've seen to date for a shooter. Everything blends together so you have a terrible time finding enemies during a fight. The controls make you feel disconnected from the game, they are unresponsive, laggy when they do work, and clunky feeling. Game runs like garbage too, fps dips a lot, the entire UI is laggy too. The finished game actually feels like an alpha stage game. Stick away from this game, I don't know if I can finish it, it's pretty bad. Shame on the developers for releasing it this way.

Oh, and way too much Jar Jar Binks...<br /><br />If you don't want to read the full review, here's the executive summary:  1) You cannot play the play sets on line; 2) If you play split screen, player 2 will not earn in-game currency, will not earn achievements, will not unlock any of the toys or sidekicks, and will not level up their figure for when they go back to solo play; 3) The system of sharing of figures (i.e., between family members) is so convoluted that I've yet to find an explanation on Disney's site that is understandable; 4) This game is plagued with so many bugs/glitches that it's hard to play a session without encountering one.  The one I experience almost every time I play is the sound effects cutting out, but not the music, often requiring a restart of the game.<br /><br />Now the longer review...<br /><br />First, like Infinity 2.0, my son and I are unable to join each other's game via Xbox Live.  The invitee always gets dropped to the dashboard.  I went back and forth with Disney support on this with 2.0 and they told me that they were aware of the issue in 2.0 but that I should be confident that it would be fixed by 3.0.  It was not.  This game crashing also occurs in the Flynn's Arcade portion of the game and I've seen other users on Infinity forums say they also have this issue.  It seems to be an issue with both the router/modem used by Comcast and the one used by AT&T U-Verse.<br /><br />The really sad thing is that even if we were able to connect, we wouldn't be able to play the campaign / play sets together over Xbox Live anyway.  Yep, you read that right -- the story mode &#34;play sets&#34;, like the Star Wars campaign that comes with this game, cannot be played over Xbox Live.  If you want to play with a friend, you have to play split screen.  I'm not sure if the upcoming expansions for Toybox Takeover and Toybox Speedway will support online play or only split screen.<br /><br />So we play it split screen -- which brings us to our next issues.  Whoever is playing as the 2nd player does not get any credit for the sparks (the game's currency for purchasing items in the toybox mode) he collects.  My son had 307 sparks when he and I started a session, and though it read over 4000 after we played a few missions, it was back to 307 when he fired up a single player session.  Worse than this, though, is that he didn't get any of his character leveling progress.  Also, player 2 cannot earn achievements in split screen.  Oh, and any toys or sidekicks that either player in split screen unlocks only go to player 1.  Player 2 is relegated to &#34;tag along&#34; status.<br /><br />Why on earth would anyone want to play as player 2 if they aren't going to get in game currency, toys or have their character level up?!?<br /><br />For a game that clearly seems to have a community and family focus, the inability to get a multiplayer game to function properly baffles me.  Furthermore, as a game clearly geared toward kids (and kids at heart), there are some enormously frustrating platforming portions of this game.  My 15 year old son, who is no slouch at gaming, said, &#34;I have no idea how Disney expects an 8 year old to be able to complete this&#34; during one mission where we both died so many times we were ready to give up.<br /><br />Also, if you are annoyed by Jar Jar Binks -- and who in their right mind isn't? -- there's about 20 minutes of the Twilight of the Republic play set that will have you ready to throw your controller at the screen.  I truly cannot fathom why Disney would interject such a huge dose of Jar Jar into this game.  It is worse than the movies.  Seriously.<br /><br />If Disney fixes the multiplayer issues and cleans up the numerous bugs, this turns into a solid 5-star game for me.  Really, there is such an amazing amount of content and creativity in this game, it's a shame to see it hobbled by the issues above.  That's what makes all of this so sad -- this game truly has the potential to be absolutely amazing, but instead it just leaves me shaking my head in disappointment.<br /><br />I will say that Disney's tech support, despite being unable to solve my son's and my inability to play a game over Xbox Live, have been very pleasant and prompt in replying to me.  Unfortunately, I've about hit my frustration threshold with this game and am ready to throw in the towel.r /><br />If Disney fixes the multiplayer issues and cleans up the numerous bugs, this turns into a solid 5-star game for me.

First off, the base is well made and looks good on a table. The characters are incredibly detailed and are worth it even if you don't own Disney Infinity. You can set the difficulty of the game so kids and adults can enjoy it. I love the whole atmosphere of the game and the creation aspect since you can do pretty much anything you want to do.<br /><br />If you have a Disney Infinity game already then I suggest not upgrading to 3.0 until you get a next gen console. This game is getting quite big and if you want to build bigger worlds and enjoy smoother gameplay then get it when you get a next gen console. This upcoming black friday would be a great time since this game would probably drop a lot and so will consoles.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>16442057</td><td>RBO5QYJGN40GM</td><td>B00NY5Y40U</td><td>531579951</td><td>Ryse: Legendary Edition</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Must have Xbox One game</td><td>Great bloody action for the bully in me!

Maybe I was getting lag from plugging this into a hub, but it just worked better overall with the adapter.<br />Buttons are okay. They respond well enough, but don't have a lot of tactile feedback. The stick has too much play, but simple tape remedies this easily. That's the only mod I've felt the need to do on this joystick: it's otherwise a competent entry-level stick that will keep you in good gaming times for a while. An octagonal restrictor, or at least something better than that dumb plastic washer, wouldn't hurt...<br />I've won records in games like Super Crate Box and Blazblue using this stick, which to me means that it works well and quickly, without introducing any serious lag.<br />You can do a lot better for a lot more money/work, or you can do a lot worse for about the same price. I don't know of any other good mid-/entry-level sticks that are still commonly available. Of those that are, most seem to be for the PS2, so again, if you want this sort of thing for PC gaming, I recommend a USB adapter over whatever firmware is built into these things. It sounds backwards, but the button mappings differ between consoles and the adapter helps with that.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>19046730</td><td>R1R6HZ0Y5F9D21</td><td>B005EOOTHW</td><td>434904268</td><td>GAMUSIC New Version HT(shooting Brake) Wireless Bluetooth 4.1 Stereo Headphones</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>A great buy, I am truly satisfied.</td><td>I really love this headset, I bought them for my PC & they work great. sound quality is great & the wireless has a good range.

To this old man, the in-game controls are getting way too complicated.  That said, I was able to play the game ONCE, and then a technical issue arose where the game got hung up in &#34;Loading roster-official...&#34; in the startup.  It will not progress any further and of this writing EA does not have a fix or patch and no timetable for when it will be fixed.  Really EA?!?!  I've attached a screenshot of my online chat with EA's support.  Shameful.<br /><br />Anyways, I miss the Madden of a few years back when it was a fun game and not a convoluted mess of various catches, coverages and blocks.

This game delivers so much suspense on different levels.  Not only do you have to have quick reflexes to survive, you have to carefully consider the decisions you make.  The game seems like it can go a lot of different directions so the replay value is there.  Gorgeous graphics and great cut scenes.  I really enjoy the diversity in the characters and i found myself really caring what happens to each of them, all but one anyway.  The only thing that turned me off from the game at first was the wonky camera angles, but you get used to it and I think it does make things more cinematic and suspenseful at times.  All in all the Butterfly system, storyline, characters, and action sequences made up for the lack of control in camera viewpoints and character movement, so if this bugs you at first as it did me, give the game a chance.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>16802733</td><td>R2T09J9FRWH1QG</td><td>B001ABLHKA</td><td>975095911</td><td>Guitar Hero World Tour</td><td>Video Games</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Fun game.</td><td>Fun game.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>22151364</td><td>RBUBKRAHC6BON</td><td>B0016N4A7E</td><td>963991253</td><td>F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Awesome!</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>1955532</td><td>R1KG2E53FWFEHA</td><td>B00UBCDZ4K</td><td>669371612</td><td>Like Replacement Power Supply Adapter Charger with Auto Voltage for Xbox 360 Slim - Black</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Came quickly and was just as described</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>126629</td><td>R1NTQYBNSLG5GI</td><td>B00DZIX394</td><td>977900495</td><td>Hyperkin Inc RetroN 5</td><td>Video Games</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>feels like I'm going to break something</td><td>I can't even play anything!

The first truly wireless headset that I've seen, the PDP AG7 is comfortable -- even with my large head. All of the other Xbox One headsets I've tested have a wire for chat that runs from the headphones to your controller. Not the PDP AG7. The key is in the clever USB transmitter that plugs into the Xbox. It connects automatically so you don't have to struggle with those awkward BlueTooth connection processes.<br /><br />One feature I especially LOVE is the separate dials for Chat and overall game volume. No more messing about with the plus or minus tabs trying to strike a balance. The PDP AG7 gives you the control to dial down (or up) chat with a dial. The same with game volume.<br /><br />The overall sound during gameplay is amazing. I can now hear when enemies are behind, to the left or right -- or above me in games like Titanfall. LOVE the sound.<br /><br />The on/off button is on the outside of the left hear piece. Just tap during game play to mute your microphone.<br /><br />The only ding for the PDP AG7 is that the mic is way too sensitive. It picks up everything -- the ceiling fan included in my case. I wish the mic were only calibrated to picking up your voice. Not a huge deal but annoying. Also, when you mute yourself the tip of the microphone (which is blue or red (extra bass)) flashes periodically to let you know you're on mute. I could see it out of the corned or my left eye (even when retracted) so I put a little piece of duct tape on it. Problem solved.<br /><br />Overall though this is by far the best headset for Xbox One I've come across. Comfortable. Excellent sound -- and truly wireless. Two thumbs up for the  PDP AG7!</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>4235973</td><td>R1E4M2WSCZUCZ6</td><td>B00ECOAX34</td><td>311796113</td><td>The LEGO Movie Videogame</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Kids love it!</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>1808626</td><td>R35CFBJQQCIWD7</td><td>B000F3AACU</td><td>396313032</td><td>Mega Man Battle Network 6: Cybeast Falzar</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>If u love megaman then this is the very best game you\"ll play (RPG stand point)</td><td>Come in a free plastic trail mix bag</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>4812157</td><td>R37P1GACU45GIC</td><td>B00NESHEW2</td><td>676839043</td><td>Batman: Arkham Knight</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>very good.

First off, the base is well made and looks good on a table. The characters are incredibly detailed and are worth it even if you don't own Disney Infinity. You can set the difficulty of the game so kids and adults can enjoy it. I love the whole atmosphere of the game and the creation aspect since you can do pretty much anything you want to do.<br /><br />The reason I dropped this to four stars was because 3 Hours into the game I was editing a home in split screen when the PS4 told me that the game save had become corrupted and everything was deleted which is quite unfortunate. The levels of the characters stay in tact but I still loose all progress made in the game and I have no idea why it happened. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. If you have kids or are a star wars/disney fan then I highly recommend this game, it's just a fun time!<br /><br />Update 8/30<br />It happened again, it appears to be a bug when you add a room in certain places in your INterior so I would recommend that you don't do much in your INterior until Disney sends out an update to patch the bug.<br /><br />Update 8/31<br />It happened again during a toy box build when putting just a few things down. This time it didn't erase all the game save, if this happens to you then don't close the game/app. Just hit continue and get back to the main menu so you start from your last checkpoint, hopefully they fix this soon since it is a bit inconvenient.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>37987371</td><td>RR2TIP7YZHLDZ</td><td>B00HVBPRUO</td><td>512137293</td><td>PlayStation Headsets</td><td>Video Games</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>these are definitely more comfortable but flawed nonetheless</td><td>I had the Sony Pulse before these and broke apart within a couple of months, these are definitely more comfortable but flawed nonetheless.

My brother gave me his, and got use to how it felt so I got this again for my second controller. You can easily take it off and put it on another controller but I just wanted more convient and to have a back up. Overall I do love the product, but it can fall off somewhat easily i.e. if you drop your controller, so be careful. I bought this bundle just in case I lose it because it did fall off several times and once you get use to how it feels, its hard to go back to the original controller. I feel naked without it. I wish it was all black too so it match my controller but on the other hand I have black carpet so its hard to find it if it drops. 4 stars because it needs variety of colors and it falls off easily sometimes (maybe glue might work).</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>1010040</td><td>R1Q5NHA2BQ8HT9</td><td>B00FJWNSWQ</td><td>799669558</td><td>Injustice: Gods Among Us</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Its a fighting game with DC characters you like!</td><td>I ejoyed it very much.

I found that the player has to score 15 to 20 under par to win (this is for a round of 4).  From watching the PGA Tour on TV,  most of the pros can win with 10 to 15  under par for the 4-round tournament.  Also, using the analog sticks to hit the ball proved exceedingly difficult.  I do not intend to spend 100 hours of practice to use the analog sticks.  What saved the game for me was the option to use the Swing meter get much better consistency of a golf shot than using the analog sticks.  Also, the unlocking of Pro Shop items and cover stories was confusing.  I was hoping that as I got better, more golf courses would be unlocked, but I did not notice that.  Same thing for items in the Pro Shop.  I played the game for a long time, but I seem to have reached a static point where no other items are unlocked.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>13103144</td><td>R2L0M20EQSQZ46</td><td>B002I0H9WM</td><td>246272039</td><td>Your Shape Fitness Evolved - Xbox 360</td><td>Video Games</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>considering there are equally good, free youtube fitness lessons available</td><td>Does its job.

My hands are average, not large (yes, I checked) and palming this with the rearmost part of it actually touching my palm (you know, palm-grip - the very comfortable way of making the mouse support your hand and not the other way around, with the round part that fits exactly into the lower region of one's palm being in the lower region of one's palm) means my fingers overshoot the tip by almost an inch on the middle finger, so I am forced to either use a claw grip or a fingertip one.\\<br /><br />Also, the finish very clearly marks with grease from the fingers, and doesn't clean particularly well for being sanded plastic.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>52550623</td><td>R1AR1E04K44URJ</td><td>B00MG654FM</td><td>361586111</td><td>Xim 4 Keyboard and Mouse Adapter for PS4, Xbox One, 360, PS3</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Best Keyboard adapter out there</td><td>Best Keyboard adapter out there!

I can say that is true but it is not perfect. It also has it's flaws which at times really can be upsetting.  First let me try to explain why i think this is a good game. I think the first thing i noticed when i popped the disc in and loaded it up was the Graphics. They are truly representative of the ps4 potential. The graphics are top notch. The cars all look beautiful, the weather, the sun and lighting effects are all realistic. You can change the time of day in most races and if u happen to be driving while the sun is setting... Well you're gona have a bad time because the sun will be blinding. But at the same time thats pretty darn impressive.  Another thing this game has going for it is the simplified/stripped down approach to racing. No silly story here. In fact right after the loading screen, you are put behind the wheel of a Mercedez Bens AMG. Not even a tutorial if i remember correctly. But thats what i like! Thats what i expect from a racing simulator. No silly story that doesnt make sense. No annoying anouncer telling you to slow down on your turns. Nothing. Heck not even a soundtrack unless you change the default settings and turn the voulume up from its original 0% it's meant to be all driving and focus on the sounds of the cars.  Ah yes the cars.. This topic is somewhat difficult.  Yes we already established that they look good, they sound good... But do they handle? Well see here's where driveclub can become an issue if you dont know what it's trying to acomplish. This game is a pure racing simulator. No forgivness. No rewind no nothing. So yeah the cars will perform as they're supposed to. Dont expect a Hyper car to handle all fine and dandy when your going 180+ mph. They all have a unique handling.and especially so depending on the weather condition. If its raining and you're in that rwd car haulling ass... Forget it. You're toast. All the cars required me to do a practice run and then go for the real race.... And i would still come out 5th place. This also has to do with the AI which is yet another thing that grinds my gears when playing this game. Just picture them as beyond professional. They are not intimidated by you and they follow a perfect line all through the track. Im serious this game will require multiple runs through an event. But yet it is still fun. Because it's really satisfying to fail a couple of times and then finally get in the zone and come out on top. Truly satisfying.  Just be prepared. This is no need for speed.  Ah yes now is everything all worth the pricetag? Well.. I would say it depends. I spent about 25 bucks. Amazon at the time that i am writing this is out of stock but that doesnt mean you cant price match it at a store! Thats what i did. I showed em the 25 dollar price. And they matched amazon. However apart from That i spent another 25 for the season pass which is the cheapest method to obtain ALL the dlc and extra cars. Without the dlc you miss out on a ton of stuff. So if u plan on playing this without the dlc then i would say its not worth it. You will be missing out on a lot.  But for 50 bucks total spent. Im really enjoying this game.  So here's a basic good/bad summary of the game  GOOD: Visuals, Sound, weather effect, simplified racing approach, cars are demanding yet rewarding to drive  Bad: AI will have you beat often. No ability to change AI Dificulty, incomplete roster of cars/events if you dont purchase season pass DLC. Does this game require patience? Yes.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>17902309</td><td>REBUBFPGJEP71</td><td>B000TYQL1O</td><td>611575482</td><td>PlayStation 2 Slim Console - Silver</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Good deal</td><td>Good product still working happy with the purchase</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>13854047</td><td>R3QXHXTCR15S1E</td><td>B001E65P72</td><td>316986472</td><td>Generic Battery Pack Cover for Xbox 360 Controller</td><td>Video Games</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>battery cover</td><td>The controller was still dead.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>22151364</td><td>RN7QVHXPUAMSK</td><td>B002EE1PBS</td><td>580030656</td><td>Dead Rising 2</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Awesome!</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>38485540</td><td>R293SZSOOV2DMC</td><td>B003O6EDSM</td><td>954708928</td><td>Mass Effect Trilogy</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>I'm new to video games, and am only in ...</td><td>I'm new to video games, and am only in the middle of MA1, but so far, I am hooked.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>39782631</td><td>RBKV4RGYU532B</td><td>B005J5K9EI</td><td>192956798</td><td>Lollipop Chainsaw</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>I like this games</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>39282589</td><td>R3TY7CG90TA73B</td><td>B010B6EKVC</td><td>375499210</td><td>Nintendo Amiibo</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>looks great!</td><td>came on time, no issues, looks great!</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>132242</td><td>R22B6HES36XMKR</td><td>B00AYABWYE</td><td>830853237</td><td>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Gates to Infinity - 3DS</td><td>Video Games</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>though once it recognizes it the gameplay is fine.

I would have given it five stars if it wasn't for my disappointment of thinking a set of games came with it from the card i received with it only to find out that it should have been tossed when they did the refurb.

I have a couple cats that love chewing on USB / charging cables.  We did not want the clutter or the risk of chewed cables by charging our controllers with USB cables.  This dock works great.  The design is self-centering.  The key is to place the controller in the cradle and let it rest which perfectly centers the controller in the cradle.  Then press down on top of the controller to activate the spring loaded charging cradle.  When it is time to remove the controller, press down on top of the controller to deactivate the spring loaded charging cradle and then remove the controller.<br /><br />It would be easy to try and insert and later remove the controller as a single motion but you might not get the flawless action that way -and may risk damage to your controller or the charger.  I think some of the bad reviews are from people attempting this instead of the two-step method of first letting the controller rest in the cradle and then pressing down to activate the charger.<br /><br />One of the best features of this unit is it does not use the front USB ports of the PS4.  This is a deal breaker of other charger designs when you need to use the PS4 USB ports for other things like the wireless headset dongles.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>28351093</td><td>R1UBGK3J3C44R5</td><td>B00RU5M6FK</td><td>881253454</td><td>Turtle Beach - Ear Force Elite 800X Premium Fully Wireless Gaming Headset - DTS Headphone:X 7.1 Surround Sound - Noise Cancellation- Xbox One, Mobile Devices</td><td>Video Games</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Would recommend if have the money</td><td>Power button broke after having for two weeks, couldn't turn them on.

This is going to be a review for X Men VS Street Fighter on The Sega Saturn. This was the home version of X Men VS Street Fighter to have & I'm not the only who believe's that. This game is loads of fun & The Saturn shows off how good the backgrounds look it's pretty much the arcade so the backgrounds look like a comic book the animations are all there & you can team up 2 characters like in The Arcade & Tag them in & out which The Playstation didn't have & having that was a big selling point. This game went on to have Marvel Superheroes vs Street Fighter & 3 Marvel vs Capcom games. The Street Fighter characters look like they do in The Alpha series. The X Men characters look like they do from the animated series from the early to late 90's. You have Ryu, Ken, Akuma or Gouki in The Japanese version. Charlie Chun Li, Cammy M Bison or Vega as he's called in The Japanese version. Zangief Dhalsim on The Street Fighter side. On The X Men side you have Magneto, Sabertooth, Juggernaut, Cyclops, Wolverine, Gambit, Rouge & Storm. There's really no story in this game only you team up 2 fighter fighter through 6 battles then fight Apocalypse in weird boss battle & whoever dealt the final blow to Apocalypse then you fight your partner at the end of the game. I know I make this sound uninteresting but this is an excellent game. The control's are great the gameplay is fun there is some replay value. The graphics are really good. If you have MAME there's no reason not to play this if you have a Saturn & an Action 4 In 1 Cart it is pricey however it won't break the bank like with Guardian Heroes or Street Fighter Zero 3. So my next review will be for Street Fighter Zero 3 imo the best version of the game.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>51478196</td><td>RR1SZ2BRD0M4V</td><td>B007PY3ZPG</td><td>107360782</td><td>Dragonpad Wii to HDMI Converter Output Video Audio Adapter - Supports All Wii Display Modes to 720P / 1080P HDTV & Monitor.</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Works well.</td><td>Needed to be able to plug my Wii into an HDMi port on my TV....worked perfectly.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>12393591</td><td>R38EADY1G1UDD7</td><td>B011DBHHMS</td><td>173950245</td><td>Mad Catz Ultra Street Fighter IV Arcade FightStick Tournament Edition 2</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Amazing!!!</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>43198525</td><td>R2MWCGZL59PPVD</td><td>B00ENFVJJO</td><td>825923905</td><td>POWER A Charger</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>N</td><td>Great Buy!</td><td>Arrived promptly.

That is until I got Unity.  Like many AC fanboys, I got this game out of sheer loyalty to the series, and the only thing I feel good about is that I didn't pay the full price for it.  Even getting it at $20 is still much, because then you have the problem of slogging through this beast of a game.  First off, this game is massive, and not in a good way.  Oddly enough the campaign is the shortest of any of the AC games, and just as forgettable.  What is amazing is the insane amount of side quests you are given to play.  That would be cool if they where all fun, but a lot of them are like just going though the motions.  There are 30 &#34;companion missions&#34; where all you do is run a ways and then just kill some random dude.  Such fun.  Some of them are interesting like the murder mysteries, but most of them are a chore to play.  Side missions should be what they are, not 80% of the freaking game!  You can do Co-op missions, and they are okay, if you actually get paired with someone doesn't run off and let you do all of the fighting.  Even after all of the patches, I still get game crashes, character freeze ups, and wonky controls.  The controls feel the worst of any AC game.  Trying to navigate Arno in stealth positions is annoying to say the least, and negates the best thing AC had to offer, and that was stealth play.  In this game you move a little bit, get spotted and just slug it out 8 dudes.  Seriously, that's the game.  The graphics where outstanding, you could easily fall in love with moving about the city.  Also, the customizing Arno was the best part of the game.  All of the color options, and trying on different parts of armor kept this game tolerable.  I really liked the detail in the belts, braces, hoods etc.  I don't recommend putting any more than 20-25 hours into this game.  I finished the campaign, about 50% of the side missions, and just said screw it.  This game showed to me that the series has officially run it's course.  A real shame, because this was a good series, but this is what happens when greedy game companies have to shell out half-assed games every year, instead of 2-3 years.  It's because fanboys like me will still by games out of loyalty.  Well no more.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>14635021</td><td>R3GOIFNT34J703</td><td>B00O8B7D02</td><td>93419205</td><td>Thrustmaster VG T300RS Racing Wheel Servo Base for PS4 and PS3</td><td>Video Games</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Great for increased immersion with racing games!</td><td>After getting two defective ones from another vendor, this one works good.

All deserve game of the year awards.  Thief is NOT a stellar or ground breaking game.  But that does not mean it is bad.<br /><br />I get the feeling folks were disappointed in this game because earlier games in the series were so highly rated.  But this is my first Thief game so I had no expectations.  Got the game free with &#34;games with gold&#34; promotion.<br /><br />Graphics and framerate are technically good.  Artistically I disliked the lack of colors, which is a typical problem with games running the Unreal engine.  Other complaints about the graphics: lots of load screens moving through the city, textures take time to load, self shadows are poorly done.  Still, overall above average.  And I think stable framerates really help playability in fps games.<br /><br />I like sneaking games like Splinter Cell, Hitman, and Metal Gear Solid.  This game plays in a similar fashion, even if it is not in the same league as those 3.  Downside is that combat is not a viable option unlike in those other games.  Sniping with the bow works fine though.<br /><br />Exploring the city is one of the best parts of the game.  There are lots of collectibles and side missions to do.  This game should keep you occupied for quite a while (unless you get bored).<br /><br />Story was not compelling, nor were the characters.  I did find some bugs with characters speaking and subtitles sometimes not happening at the right time.<br /><br />Overall, an average game.  Nothing horrible about it, but lots of little things wrong with it.  Best for gamers who like sneaking games.  Probably worth it at a heavily discounted price (say, under $10).</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>13538996</td><td>R81EZG8UKXLZX</td><td>B002I0K3Z2</td><td>793750162</td><td>Dance Central 3</td><td>Video Games</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Four Stars</td><td>Teens Loved It</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>106761</td><td>R6ADTH3PQAE5M</td><td>B00KBZHTBC</td><td>870215622</td><td>WWE 2K15</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>It was great</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>2264201</td><td>R3PEC6BS44O0TA</td><td>B00CMD752O</td><td>50727149</td><td>Ben 10 Omniverse 2</td><td>Video Games</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Three Stars</td><td>this was for my kid and he thought it was better</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>30745397</td><td>RAVTOMAXWQH98</td><td>B0050SVPCO</td><td>453625196</td><td>AmazonBasics Carrying Case for Nintendo 3DS, DS Lite, DSi and DSi XL (Officially Licensed by Nintendo)</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>great value, keeps ds unscratched and protected while traveling</td><td>Great case, fits my 3DS XL perfectly (that's what it's made for even though it might be hard to find in the description).

For the longest time, I've been saying that Madden needs a definitive turnkey/pivotal title that'll be the true platform to continuously build the game up from.  Madden 16 to me is definitely that benchmark title as the feel of football is true and completely undeniable regarding what's going on here for sure.  Let me get into this a bit deeper.<br /><br />WR/DB Interactions: Out the box, you had a good number of people on the EA access 10 hour trial screaming out how catching was OP (overpowered), and were getting caught over end over end on deep balls in 1 v 1 situations mainly.  That's just the issue there though, people needed to learn how to use the new in game mechanics.  The days of just pressing Y or Triangle are gone.  You must learn to press A or X and play the receiver, spotlight the receiver if your secondary isn't great, assign the extra man or adjust your playcalling to have that safety over top to defend those situations just like they do IN REAL LIFE!!  There's only a few DBs/Safeties in the league that are great 1 on 1 defenders, and even they get additional support as they'll get beat too (ex: Patrick Peterson vs Amari Cooper is a great example of this).  If there were anything I'd say was an issue with this, it would be the frequency of one handed catches that would need to be toned down a bit.  Otherwise, I strongly suggest people get in the skills trainer and practice field and learn how to effectively use the mechanics instead of making the blind complaints because you're not winning like you were used to back then.  Times are changing for real now!!!<br /><br />QB Pass Placement/Inaccuracies/AI: In Madden 15 the pass innacuracies were introduced, but due to community complaints, it was toned down and the &#34;Robo QB&#34; was back in full effect.  This year it's back and not going anywhere.  In addition to dedicated pass placement mechanics, you have the most control since the PS2 days when it comes to how you want to deliver the ball, high over the shoulder lobs, mid-level passes that'll sail over LBs and in that hole within the zone where only the receiver can get it, or throwing it low and away so the risk of a pick on that curl or comeback route is reduced to nil and would only be a drop or a breakup by defender contact.  Now you can clearly see the CPU AI difference between Geno Smith and Tom Brady when it comes to how they are at making reads, accuracy on throws, and how they also deal with defensive pressure when the pocket collapses.<br /><br />Run Game/Trenches: Regarding the running game this year, the controlled player movement is greatly improved, as the ballcarrier feels much more weighed down and attached to the field.  Especially when it comes to making quick cuts, and bursting through holes, even when utilizing skill moves too, the footwork is highly noticeable and the player movement is the best out of ANY football game out in my opinion.  When it comes to the run game and reading blocks, you MUST BE PATIENT!!  You have to allow the blocks to develop and make the proper reads instead of mashing turbo and getting stuffed prematurely.  Speaking on the Trenches the O-Line/D-Line battling is much more balanced and the sack totals aren't nearly where they were in the history of the franchise.  Now it's more of a progressive win/loss battle to get into the backfield, unless you have a beast like JJ Watt/Gerald McCoy/Ndamukong Suh on the line you're controlling.  Even with that in place, with the CPU QB AI, they don't hold the ball nearly as much as they used to and will already have made their read and threw the ball, or will try to buy time by moving in or rolling out the pocket and throwing the ball away.<br /><br />Penalties: The final part to discuss here are the penalties, they're FINALLY back and count more than a way of impacting how gameplay outcomes are potentially determined like in years past.  Now the sliders determine the frequency of what penalties get called.  What I like even more is that when the penalties are called, there are clear animations to show what had happened onfield.  Whether it's a holding, PI, facemask or an illegal block in the back, they all have a visual depiction to go along with what penalty took place.  They still are lacking every penalty legible for the game at this point, and also a challenge system a la NFL 2K5 where I can choose what I want to challenge regardless of what took place on the field instead of the game dictating what can or can't be challenged.  Once again, this is a legit foundation to build upward from.<br /><br />In closing, these gameplay refinements make this the most realistic playing Madden title to date, and these past 3 games (Madden 13 - 15) were the building blocks that helped 16 set itself up to truly be great going forward.  With some tuning/patching within these core gameplay aspects.  Madden 16 can be a truly official title to set the tone of true football authenticity and replication for the future of this franchise.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>46382101</td><td>R21C298JHQLVPG</td><td>B00KTNSKT6</td><td>308091748</td><td>Just Dance 2015</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>very funny</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>11746079</td><td>RRNG9WD9YYPRN</td><td>B0018QOWEU</td><td>263186370</td><td>Generic New Wired Infrared Sensor Bar for Nintendo Wii Controller</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Perfect</td><td>Works just as the original.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>22151364</td><td>R1W0C2KRR993K4</td><td>B003O6CB6S</td><td>603505561</td><td>Call of Duty: Ghosts</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Awesome!</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>4482042</td><td>RQ9ZN2AUDUPE4</td><td>B00DC9SWWE</td><td>51619915</td><td>Titanfall</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Great games my son loves it</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>23145236</td><td>R11INON7LAB6GH</td><td>B0086V5V8G</td><td>829459738</td><td>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell Blacklist</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Five Stars</td><td>Good</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>4108137</td><td>R2V3IQUHDA9EOO</td><td>B0018KM6GM</td><td>702032351</td><td>Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War II</td><td>Video Games</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>One Star</td><td>they sold me a game with the key already used bs</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>49627536</td><td>R3IUADZJ9Z5IKT</td><td>B0016HLABO</td><td>71384332</td><td>Rock Band</td><td>Video Games</td><td>3</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Three Stars</td><td>Doesn't work with band hero instruments.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>11683598</td><td>R1EKD9AX30IVZ1</td><td>B00VHVFQ0A</td><td>779514791</td><td>Generic PS3 handle bracket black</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Good mount.</td><td>Works as it's meant to.

The problem with DS2 on last generation hardware was that they were hitting the ceiling in terms of what they could do to top the original Dark Souls from simple animations to challenges. This PS4 port...well, port would be an insulting term--blows away its last gen counterpart. If it's your first time playing, you're in for danger. If you're a last gen vet, take all your pre-existing knowledge of each area and chuck it in the garbage. The enemy placement has been remixed and rebalanced. I feel that's a great bonus to the vets because the experience is still going to be grueling and fresh. Environmental details are vastly improved. Light shines bright, fog and mist are impenetrable, and darkness is oppressive. You can make out the careful detail of the Tseldora Cove spiders, Alonne knights are more ninja like in their ambushes and appearances. The dark orb hurling giants of Harvest Valley can now target you upwardly on the cliff at the beginning, so be more tactful on the arrow sniping.<br /><br />From Software did a wonderful job and I view this as the true vision of Dark Souls 2 made real.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>43872040</td><td>R2GLXNG3G3K54Q</td><td>B00APTQR62</td><td>449739272</td><td>Nintendo Wii D4 D32 D2A D2B D2C DVD Rom Complete Drive Replacement Repair Part</td><td>Video Games</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Not new, but worked perfectly.</td><td>Product said new, but had cosmetic issues, you can tell it was pulled from a system, but in the end, it worked perfectly.</td><td>2015-08-31</td></tr><tr><td>US</td><td>4850641</td><td>R1200C6RR5J46B</td><td>B00QW2TBWS</td><td>359362227</td><td>16-bit Entertainment System</td><td>Video Games</td><td>5</td><td>4</td><td>4</td><td>N</td><td>Y</td><td>Works great..</td><td>Works great...plays all of my games; especially rockman and forte, and final fight guy for super  Famicom.

While not being difficult to do, this sometimes took more time than it should because there was NO margin for error.  THIS charger uses the &#34;headphone&#34; input and simply requires you to rest the controller on the deck and &#34;click&#34; in down into place.

You copy that to one window then type in the other super secret code that comes on the back of a book, hit authenticate or whatever and it terminates, saying you should make sure the unlock request is entered correctly. Well, yes you idiots, I know how to copy and paste. You cannot play even offline and you have to start all over again. There is a securerom link to go to if you can't get it working. It doesn't work either. It's so secure you can't access it. I do have the xbox version so I can play it but I prefer PC gaming.<br /><br />Maybe the steam version is the way to go. I haven't tried it and am not planning to buy the damn thing a third time but that might be the way to go instead of footling around with the disc version. I do not recommend wasting your time trying to get through Rockstar's DRM. Honestly you idiots, pirates will pirate. Regular users are the ones who get scred by DRM. When will you learn?",

My game shelf was over flowing so I decided to clean things up a bit, therfore, I sold my &#34;AC3 - AC4&#34; games to purchase this set. ( I had never owned AC Liberation before) It's cheaper and more convenient than buying each game separate for the new buyers! I guess the only thing I'm surprised were not included were the Expansion Packs/DLC for each game. These are NOT new games (AC 4 might be an acception) so I am somewhat surprised that Ubisoft continue to make players pay for these old expansion packs.",

Plus it adds dual charging stations for controllers and adds two extra USB ports. While this item comes with no instructions on setup it's still very easy to connect. Just know that this stand doesn't &#34;Lock In&#34; your PS4 and while it firmly supports it vertically it will not prevent an accidental overturn if you do not have it on a firm shelf.<br /><br />The dual fans make some noise but not enough to distract you over background noises. As for the USB ports, you connect a USB lead from the stand to one of the open ports on your PS4, this gives you one open port on the PS4 and 3 USB ports on the stand itself. Also if you have the PS4 settings in Rest Mode it will automatically shut down the fans when it turns off power to the USB ports. I found this stand to everything advertised and a well made 3rd party accessory for your PS4 for the price.",

         "There are some sports that are better live than on TV. Some of the intensity of hockey is lost on TV, the relaxation of watching a baseball game on a nice day surpasses sitting in the living room. But sometimes the commentary adds a lot to the game. A bit of context, some history, something you wouldn’t get being at the game itself.<br /><br /> I’ve played, and enjoyed, each of the Batman Arkham games that have come out. Arkham Knight is no different. It has an open world to explore, the same melee style combat and stealth action as previous games. There are a few additions to the game. A heavy dose of Batmobile, an overhaul of the game world into utter chaos, a new hierarchy of villains and a more involved cast of supporting characters. It’s the same style game revamped, and a little darker than previous installments.<br /><br /> The game picks up with the death of the Joker from Arkham Origins. It’s Halloween of the following year and after a threat to the city everyone but the police force evacuates as gangs and militia take over. The primary adversary through the game is the Arkham Knight, a militaristic, unknown villain who leads a mercenary army into Gotham under the direction of Scarecrow who is trying to release a massive dose of fear gas into the city.<br /><br /> There are two big additions to the game. The well-advertised, and a bit controversial Batmobile which can be switched between a high powered sports car and a tank. While the tank combat is enjoyable, though fairly easy since enemies telegraph their attacks, the heavy reliance on the Batmobile can become cumbersome. Flying from rooftop to rooftop is both enjoyable and quicker than driving through Gotham’s winding streets most of the time, but there are numerous sections of the game where the Batmobile is shoe-horned into the gameplay. Open up an area, go back for the Batmobile to open up the next section, rinse and repeat. While the car adds some nice variety to the game it can act like an anchor, slowing down gameplay by making you use it. The other big addition to the game is the Joker as a supporting character. This, to me, is the more enjoyable of the additions though it doesn’t really add anything to the gameplay. Through events in the game the Joker becomes part of Batman’s psyche, visible and audible to Batman, but no one else. He provides commentary on events and pokes at Batman’s actions. While the games are fun of their own right, the color commentary really adds something special to the game. It provides greater context of the events and humor in an otherwise serious game.<br /><br /> The world is very similar to the past two installments in the series, Arkham City and Arkham Origins, a sprawling cityscape of Gotham. The game takes place over the course of a single night so it’s always dark and raining from beginning to end. The main difference in the world is that the city has erupted into utter chaos. In the previous games gangs roved the city, but Arkham Knight takes it to another level as a militarized force has moved into the city alongside the normal array of gangs filling the city streets and making it more likely to run into a fight going from point A to point B.<br /><br /> The normal array of hand to hand combat and stealth carries over from the previous games. You swing from rafter to rafter or crawl through ducts taking out enemies one by one silently until you burst out, or the more likely scenario for me is being seen, for hand to hand combat. The same array of gadgets are available to you as previous games in the series, the bat claw, the disruptor for turning off weapons, smoke pellets, you get the idea, with a few new additions like a voice modulator, which really just put up more walls to progression that you unlock through the story. There is a new fear take down mechanism that allows you to do multiple takedowns in a short period, along with a series of new automated enemies such as drones you can hack and automatic turrets you must avoid. As mentioned before the Batmobile is now playable and there is a good amount of tank combat which is nimble and enjoyable. You steer the Batmobile which is able to move in all directions quickly, while you combat automated tanks which telegraph their attacks with light beams that change color when they have a lock. It makes the combat a bit simplistic, but it’s a nice change of pace from the normal melee combat you usually encounter in the games.<br /><br /> The graphics look great. The city is dark and ominous. The characters are well rendered and the voice acting is still superb. The main complaint I have with the presentation is there are times where Batman’s mouth doesn’t move while speaking.<br /><br /> There is a ton of side content, but it can be a little annoying. While the content itself is well-done, it involves finding it. Sometimes radio banter will alert you to where the event is, but even with that it can be difficult to locate at times. It would be nice if once you get a clue as to where the content is it would mark it, but it doesn’t. Sometimes I would hear some banter that would alert me. I would fly in the direction indicated but not see where the event was and there wouldn’t be any more banter.<br /><br /> Arkham Knight is a great game in its own right. It’s another high-quality installment in a great series. But the addition of the Joker to provide commentary really puts things over the top. It may not actually add anything to the gameplay, but getting a glimpse at Batman’s thoughts and insecurities is a great added bonus to the game. The commentary may not be a focal point, it may not be something any focused on, but it really adds something to the game. It can help fill in the gaps, it can help bring things alive, it can help give a glimpse at something I wouldn’t have been able to see otherwise. It also makes up for some of the short comings that have arisen with the new mechanics. The additional barriers to progression you have to unlock, having to hunt down side content or the sometimes overzealous use of the Batmobile.",

         "This review is based on the game, not the contents (Boba Fett, etc..)<br /><br />I've been a fan of this series since the original (1.0),  and if you go for the the 3.0 starter set on any platform, you will soon find out just how well your money was spent. With each release, Disney manages to stuff their game with so many things to do, and 3.0 takes this further with a mind-boggling amount of content to tackle.  Long after many AAA hardcore games are completed, Disney Infinity will keep chugging along with something new to find. Having Star Wars to bring in their latest series was a no-brainer for Disney - and everyone predicted it would happen.  I'm happy to say, Disney went into overdrive with this release as they have done the Star Wars license mighty justice.  The gameplay is spot on this time with fun quests and tons of side missions. Unlike the previous Marvel Super Heroes, Star Wars's missions vary from ground  to space, keeping the adventures fresh at all time. The combat is highly improved with spectacular moves that are more complex and satisfying. I mean, come on - lightsabers? That's all you need to know.  Both Twilight of the Republic and Rise against the Empire are equally enjoyable, and even after completion, you'll be back to revisit and will find much more to do.<br /><br />Back on Earth, without even firing up one of the Star Wars Playsets, you'll find an overwhelming amount to explore, thanks to the Toy Hub (not to be confused with the Toy Box). The Hub is the center for everything.  It's segmented like a pie, with one section for racing, another combat, platforming, etc.. Each section has an intro level and sub levels that you can play which introduce you to the game's mechanics. It's brilliantly put together. One particular area host a farming simulator for your sidekicks. Oh, sidekicks are mini-sized Disney characters that hang with you during your questing. They can be told to follow and fight along, or farm for vegetables and other surprises. As your crops grow, you can feed your sidekicks to increase their stats. Better stats equals more abilities like cooler weapons, and other interesting gear. It really adds an RPG feel to the infinity series, and those little folk are pretty kick butt in battle! When I first heard about farming being added to the series, I was scratching my head, but from what I heard, people are spending hours just in that section alone!<br /><br />The Disney Main Street area of the hub is a sight to behold, and it's here where you can stop at Flynn's Arcade (of Tron fame) to jump into some on-line multiplayer games, or hang out at the El Capitan theater and play community levels, or even watch videos based around the game. Trust me when I say, the Hub is going to keep you real busy.  And finally, there's the Toybox, the heart of the Disney Infinity empire.This time around, the ToyBox has received a lot of new gadgets and scenery, so expect an abundance of community levels that utilize the new features.<br /><br />Besides the two Star Wars PlaySets, there is currently a third which is based on Pixar's awesome animated movie,  Inside Out. This takes a different approach than the other sets, as it brings pure 2D/3D platforming bliss to the table, and dazzling it is!  Then there are the two expansion games. Unlike the playsets, which come with characters and an adventure crystal, these expansions are just a special single disc. When dropped on the portal, they add an all new game to the already massive mix; currently, there are two:  Toybox Takeover which is a dungeon crawler where any Disney/Marvel/Star Wars Character can quest , and the highly touted DI Speedway, which is a Mario Kart-like racing game. All these sets unlock even more toys to add to the already massive selection in the Toybox.  Oh, and if that wasn't enough, there's more DI goodness coming down the pike later later this year,  including a new playset based on the upcoming, highly anticipated movie in the Star Wars saga,  The Force Awakens, and an all out brawl fest titled Marvel Battlegrounds which will support four player combat.<br /><br />With all the excellence that is 3.0, there are a few things that I feel need attention:<br /><br />- Saving a game on the Disney Cloud using the PS4 is still super slow. I'm not sure how is is on other formats.<br />- Some of the tools in the Toybox I thought would have made the jump to light speed like the rest of the game, instead, they remain the same, like the yellow trigger cube which is cumbersome to resize.<br />- The Toybox still restricts certain actions to a certain type of toy. For example, if you want a particular object to be &#34;collectible&#34; in a quest, you can only use what the developers chose as a collectible item. At least there's a better selection than last year.<br />- This year's amazing new path creator is great for making objects follow an assigned path. It will surely take community games to a whole new level. The first thing that came to my mind when I read about the Path Tool's capabilities was ROLLERCOASTERS! Well, turns out - there's no coaster track,  train track, or even a coaster car. There are coaster sounds effects, though? Odd, right?<br /><br />In closing, there are so many features with Disney Infinity 3,0, it would be painful to have to write a review and list them all. Whether you're 6 or 65, you're in for one of the big gaming treats of 2015.brawl fest titled Marvel Battlegrounds which will support four player combat.

Its a chore just to get from one side of a town to another. Then in battle sometimes the game doesn't load the enemy animations when you hit them at first so they just kind of stand around like they are not sure what's going on. If you can look past all of that you then have the constant fear that the game will crash, and you WILL not get through a play through without it crashing, you just have to hope you don't lose a character and have to start all over (that one happened to me... Thanks lionhead). For some positives the story is ok and the characters are engaging enough to hold your attention. But honestly with all the bugs and fear based anxiety its probably not worth anything more than a boredom induced rental.",

         "This is an awesome way to make sure that there are always charged up controllers for our PS4. Our Playstation gets used constantly in our house and it seems like we could never have enough controllers charged since the console is only able to charge 2 of them at a time.<br /><br />Having this has made a huge difference, now we always make sure to have controllers charging on this station in addition to the 2 that charge directly from the console. I love that this can be plugged in anywhere using a USB adapter.<br /><br />The charging station seems to charge the controllers pretty quickly and puts on a near little LED light show while doing it. I do have to admit that it is pretty fun to watch light up in the evenings, the kids think it is really cool as well. I received one to review and it has been getting a ton of use around our household. It's a great, inexpensive way to be sure you always have controllers at the ready.",

Sometimes, I'd have to sit there for 10 minutes or more while signing into EA's servers with a lot of restarting.  10/16/15 Update.....  When you exit out of the game, you can go right back in and pick up where you left off.  Well if you turn off your Xbox and come back a day later, you will try to pick up where you left off and find that it just says loading and never logs into the EA servers.  I found that I would have to start another game and eject the Madden disc and log out.  Then put the Madden 16 disk in and let it load.  It would load from the beginning and work right away and the kinect would log me back into my account.  I only have to do this for Madden.",

         "I bought the &quot;Original&quot; Dishonored on the street date sometime in October a few years back<br />I loved the 360 version I put at least 35hrs. into it  (Not counting the DLC)<br />But, the truth be told the game looked horrible<br />Dishonored should've never ever been put on last Gen Hardware (PS3 &amp; XB360) The game was not built for hardware that old<br />Arkane Studios and Bethesda should've just put it out for the PC master race 'Cause God knows they deserve everything as far as gaming goes!<br />But, they didn't they lied to a massive consumer base and put out a super unpolished game and sold it for a low low asking price of $60.00 US<br />I payed 60.00 for my 360 version on day one<br />did i truly get what i payed for honestly No even though I loved the game<br /><br />When I heard they were putting out a re-mastered Definitive edition of Dishonored<br />I was all in on one condition price the $40.00 SRP is worth every penny<br />I pre-ordered it as soon as I could cause unlike all the phony trolls<br />I had faith console gamer's would get the proper version of Dishonored we never got<br /><br />My copy arrived last Tues (Thanks to Amazon Prime) But, haven't had time to play it<br />until Sat night I pop it in put 3.5 hrs into<br />and I truly forgot what a amazing game Dishonored is (It's on Par with the Likes of BioShock in being a massive living breathing world like nothing your ever see before)<br />On to the elephant in the room<br />Is this a true remastered version compared to the 360 version it's night and day<br />The clown who said it's a port don't understand what port means State of Decade (360) to State of Decade (XOne) was a bloody port<br />This is far from a port and all the so-called PC gamer's why would you be playing a XOne game???<br />This review is for console gamer's not insecure little boys who have to spend $2,500.00 on a gaming PC to brag about that very rig to total strangers about what there PC can do they don't brag about there car or the chick they are banging but, a bloody box that plays video games seriously..........<br />This is by no means a waste of money of all the cheap money grab over the last year or so with re-releases of titles this is one more gamer's should be on board with not fighting over it not being 4k resolution! Jesus this is a hobby (btw who can really afford 4k equipment?)<br />If you wanna add a strong title to your XOne library this is the one to do it<br />The game will never look so good on home consoles (unless you have money to burn on a super expensive high end PC)<br />this is the way to go!<br />I beat the 360 version of it clocked in 40hrs including the dlc (so you can get plenty of hours out of this title)<br /><br />Audio:<br />The sound to is also much better if you have a good home theater set-up you'll get DTS Sound (DTS is the best way to experience sound but, I'm just a huge fan of  the DTS Audio format)<br />The V/O Cast is just crazy Good<br />Susan Sarandon as (Granny Rags)<br />Lena Headey  as (Callista Curnow )<br />Brad Dourif  as (Piero Joplin)<br />Michael Madsen  (Daud)<br />John Slattery  (Admiral Havelock)<br />Chloë Grace Moretz  (Lady Emily Kaldwin) This is her Pre massive Star she is Not returning to Dishonored II<br />Billy Lush  (The Outsider)<br />Carrie Fisher  (she did alternative v/o work I honestly missed her v/o work)<br />This is a great example of using legit Hollywood Actors doing v/o work for the game!<br />everyone is so damn good<br />The biggest minus is the character you play Corvo never speaks and doesn't have a speaking voice!<br />I forgot about that till i played this version<br /><br />The Controls<br />these are a mixed bag i only say that cause on the xbox one they are just as good as the previous 360 controller<br />It takes some getting used to the handling isn't nearly as good as Bio Shock (You can do as much but, you don't feel as though you can pull it off as easy!) Hopefully that makes sense<br/>Once you get the hang of how to play the game it becomes second nature....<br />I hope The Controls are better streamlined for Dishonored II<br />The Game play this is where Arkane/Bethesda were dishonest with gamer's<br />If you only play games like COD ,Battlefield, Halo  keep going this ain't gonna be your cup of tea<br />The game is a FPS Stealth Hybrid<br />I played it the first time the complete wrong way with major Chaos Killing almost everyone got the Bad ending<br />They give you a gun don't use the gun (ok you can use the gun but, if you kill to many Guards, etc. and bodies are found) it gets much harder  That's the biggest problem with this game imo<br />It doesn't know what it wants to be is it a FPS is it a FP Stealth title (They offer lots of cool weapons but, most of them will kill) and you get strikes against you if you cause to much Chaos.....<br />It's a odd Balancing act<br />As crazy as it sounds after I played the Re-boot of Thief I had more appreciation for this title<br />Both Dishonored and Thief share a lot of great ideas/concepts<br />Thief just got blasted cause only FPS can be excepted in this day and age<br />you also get all the DLC<br />The Knife of Dunwall,<br />The Brigmore Witches,<br />&amp; Dunwall City Trails  (This IMO is the only thing on the entire disc that sucks)<br />This is a great example where you as the consumer has to make up your own mind if this is truly a worth wild purchase (I think it is!

         "I decided to purchase a backup controller as soon as the R2 button broke on my original.  Now, as far as the &#34;feel&#34; of a controller in my hands, this is hands down, the VERY best of them all!  The feel, the look, the touch screen on top.  Everything works perfectly to give you that great gaming experience.  However, when it comes to the components that make up the insides of the controller?!  Well, that's a completely different thing.  The trigger buttons are plastic and when you get to shooting those bad guys, well, the plastic tends to tear apart.  This happened to me while playing [[ASIN:B00SHXKC8M Borderlands: The Handsome Collection - Playstation 4]].  I played through the original Borderlands, the 2nd, and even the 3rd (prequel) on my Xbox 360, MULTIPLE times, without having a problem.  However, only a few hours into this game, the trigger pin shattered, leaving me without a gun in the middle of Pandora?!<br /><br />Apparently, this is a rather common problem as you'll find countless videos about it on Youtube.  Do yourself a favor and go purchase R2 & L2 replacement buttons from eBay.  That way if you do find yourself with a broken controller, you can fix it right up.  And it is rather easy to fix.  So that's definitely a good thing!",

         "This is an absolute hot mess.  EA has become infatuated with selling virtual football cards for hundreds of dollars and gimmicky drafts with dead  and retired football players on Ultimate Teams, and in the process has destroyed the core game.<br /><br />CFM mode fantasy draft is virtually useless.  You are unable to sort by categories and higher overall rated players are rated less than the mysterious rating placed upon players by EA.  This is worse than the so called perfect players.  I am a JJ Watt fan but 99 in all categories? This is getting ridiculous.  They've changed things that didn't need changing.  Some VP at EA must've had their 12 year old nephew rate the players.<br /><br />They are so enamored with one handed catches by receivers that the rest of the game doesn't work.<br /><br />Case in point.<br /><br />Just played game with Eli Manning after CFM fantasy draft.  On 2nd and three Manning throws a 27 yard pass to Avant who catches and runs for 8 more yards.  After great fanfare by Sims and company, the game cycles to the next play and its mysteriously 3rd and ten and the announcers are talking about how terrible the offense has been playing.<br /><br />Later in the fourth quarter my DB intercepts a pass on the 1 yard line.  Next play Manning takes the snap to throw from the end zone.  The line holds, no one in the backfield.  The play freezes and it says its a safety, and wants me to punt.  Manning is standing there holding the ball.<br /><br />Continually you select a play and when you go to choose a hot route, not only does the art disappear.  But the play that starts is not one you've selected, and its not even in your list of audibles.  The tight ends disappear.  This is the worst Madden ever.<br /><br />This  list  of wierdness could go on forever.  Don't buy it.  Go back to Madden 15 until they fix it.. Maybe 2 years from now.  These are not small glitches.  These are major problems.  It is totally unplayable.<br /><br />EA thinks that eye candyand one handed catches can distract you enough to realize that you can't even play the game.",

You were not able to just wonder around in large areas like skyrim and fallout.<br />The graphics were good but the challenges were not that great. It was extremely easy to solve the puzzles. It seemed like this would be for a younger gamer or someone just starting out.<br />I would not recommend this game to people that are looking for an open world experience or looking for a challenging game. I played through it one time and completed 85% of the game and it still only took maybe 6 to 8 hours, I probably could have finished the game in 4 to 5 hours if I would have just played through and not looked for additional stuff.<br />I will not play this game again, there are no extra’s in the game and once you completed the first go around then there does not seem to be a reason to keep going. I was going to give this a 3 rating but once I wrote down the information I will have to go with a 2",

There's lots of videos on how to do this, it's not difficult, but this thing isn't plug and play. My advice: just keep it plugged in and you won't have to go through this process as much (I just have to since i use it on my laptop).

         "I've had the game for over a week now and I have to say it's pretty awesome. The gameplay is a step above Awakening, the characters are great, and the story is amazing. This game requires a lot more strategy then Awakening did. I sometimes spend over an hour to do some chapters. Be warned that this is a Japanese game and you will need a Japanese 3DS to play it. However, there are hacks you can use to play it on non Japanese 3DS like tubehack for example. I definitely recommend this game and I can't wait for it to be released in America I'll buy it again.",

         "I have several versions of each of these games for some reason, but I don't mind.  Some are originals such as MGS on PS1 (2 discs!) and MGS3 regular and Subsistence (Monkeys!).  I was still compelled to purchase this since it bumps up a series I love so much to HD (or near in most cases) into a compact 2-disc package and the price was right.  Strangely, it is missing &#34;Portable Ops&#34; which introduced the whole comrade system used in Peacewalker and MGSV.  Anyway, to me it was worth it to play Peacewalker with dual analogs and the Ashley Wood motion comics with full voice.  Be advised though:<br />-No art book was included (I understand this is a second printing)<br />-MGS and MGS VR Missions are both downloads via code included on paper insert.  Have not tested if they work on the Vita yet.<br />-Both motion comics are on Disc 2.  When loaded, look under the &#34;Video&#34; icon on the PS Home Screen.<br /><br />Enjoy!",

         "I have never played Disney Infinity 1.0 or 2.0 so I am basing this on my experience with 3.0 so far. First off, the base is well made and looks good on a table. The characters are incredibly detailed and are worth it even if you don't own Disney Infinity. You can set the difficulty of the game so kids and adults can enjoy it. I love the whole atmosphere of the game and the creation aspect since you can do pretty much anything you want to do.<br /><br />If you have a Disney Infinity game already then I suggest not upgrading to 3.0 until you get a next gen console. This game is getting quite big and if you want to build bigger worlds and enjoy smoother gameplay then get it when you get a next gen console. This upcoming black friday would be a great time since this game would probably drop a lot and so will consoles.",

I couldn't get one to work on my controller and I'm sure that's the reason. At any rate, I don't care. My controller looks totally cool and serves every other purpose.<br /><br />If you're looking to upgrade a couple of regular controllers you have lying around, this is one cool, affordable way to do it. I would've given it 5 stars, but the fact that it won't allow for the attachment of the messaging keyboard kinda sucks. Still, it's a cool looking addition and I'm loving that part of it.",

         "A great game that could lay the benchmark for future interactive experiences.  Unfortunately it isn't as ambitious as it could be.  While I enjoyed my time and recommend it to others, the choices you make only affect what may or may not happen to a character, but not the overall story.  This was what I found to be disappointing.  Some main characters, no matter what decisions you make, will always be in the final chapter.  Only then can you decide if they live or die.  I won't necessarily say I felt deceived, but played instead.<br /><br />The game said I can choose who to save or let die.  While that's true, the game sells itself short by not letting players ultimately decide when and where it can necessarily happen.  The game uses a butterfly effect system that notifies players when future events have been altered by the choices they just made.  This system could have been more revolutionary if the game wasn't so restricted with its storytelling.<br /><br />The most simplest way I can explain this is that each character, besides the main ones, are being strung along for the ride.  They each have their particular moments for them and them alone.  It's the player's job to make sure they get there by not cutting the cord with the decisions they make or don't make at a designated time.  Ultimately, the game has a story to tell and will tell it regardless if you want to play along or not.<br /><br />This game and future games like it can improve by allowing some deviation from the main plot.  Even letting players choose the blue pill (Matrix reference).  If Neo takes it, there is no story or film.  For example, I wouldn't mind if I played the game in a way everyone died within the first couple of hours and it was game over.  Characters shouldn't have their set paths unless we can decide how they get there.  This is ultimately where I would like this genre to go.  If it doesn't, we're just being pulled along as well.eady been written by the choices you made prior.&#34;  You can see the pros and cons to this, but ultimately the decision made by the developers encourages more replay-ability.  Normally I would frown upon this, but the game isn't that long.  It's about 8-10 hours depending how much you explore.  It's split up in to chapters so a replay isn't much of a chore.  All you have to do is put up with the unskippable cutscenes, but the acting is well done and you can make certain changes to them with the choices you make.  All in all, this game was better than I thought.  I was expecting another The Order, but having an interactive experience with good characters in an overall fun story.  The game is definitely worth your time.  Controls leave more to be desired, but games like this are a good alternative to the norm and leave hope for more old school style Survival Horror games.",

However as far as I know, it was sold in top quality stores in Japan, and the Victor Saturn controller looks cool for the year 1997.<br /><br />I've played some good JP games I still have, such as Street Fighter Alpha, Puyo Puyo Sun, Sonic Jam, Legend of Oasis, and Dragon Ball Z: Shin Butouden (the superior game than Ultimate Battle 22). Of course every 2~4 years you have to replace the lithium save battery known as CR2032.<br />Otherwise you'll need a genuine Backup Power Memory cartridge for a lot of saves.

Some days I could be grinding Destiny for hours on end, and this will come in hand.  I have it sitting on top of my cabinet and it keeps the PS4 in an upright position perfectly.  It fit the PS4 perfectly, and was an exact fit.  The controllers also go in and fit in perfectly.    There is a slight noise to it, but it is expected, as there is a fan running.  The blue light can get distracting, so you might want to put some electrical tape over it if it is in your line of sight.  The fan comes on automatically when the PS4 is on, and shuts off with the PS4, if you are powering it via the USB port on the PS4.  You can also manually shut if off by pushing the button on the front.    It's well made and does its job.  If you have the space for it, and play a lot, I would recommend investing in one.    *I received this item for free for an unbiased and honest review.",

If you're planning to use a keyboard attachment for chatting during games or typing while on Netflix, signing in, etc..., this shell case could prevent the plug from reaching the connection point inside. I had that problem with both of the covers I used to replace my XBox 360 controller shells.<br /><br />Still, if you're looking to upgrade a couple of regular controllers you have lying around, this is one cool, affordable way to do it. I would've given it 5 stars, but the fact that it won't allow for the attachment of the messaging keyboard kinda sucks. Still, it's a cool looking addition and my grandson loves it.",

         "This game is not a game changer but definitely a fun experience. This game will keep you as the player engaged from start to finish. As some games like this type lose steam towards the end, Until Dawn keeps steady from start to finish. I beat this twice in 24 hours just because I was drawn into the story.<br /><br />Very impressive with the graphics and the feel. Sometimes the frame rate is quirky in some spots but nothing noticeable to most casual players. While the camera angles do not adjust much, this adds to the appeal and creep factor this game has. Controls make sense as it makes your characters look and react with a sense of reality that applies to this game.<br /><br />The game play itself has a great balance of presenting the story but making sure you are ultimately in control. Tensions grow as you run through areas making sure anticipate your next action, but you cannot over commit as the command may change or speed up. Your choices matter for the most part and are hidden all throughout the game. You don't ALWAYS know what choice you make is that pivotal moment in a characters life and that makes it exciting.<br /><br />So why 4 stars? As much as I love it, I would not spend 60 dollars for this game. I feel its appeal is awesome but will fade after about the 3rd play through. While it would be nice to say I wish this game would be bigger, that's not the case. The design of the game itself just becomes self limiting at points. DLC would be great, but besides the bonus chapter for preorders, I doubt that will happen.<br /><br />In short, your first playthrough will be amazing and create an experience that you will remember for a long time however multiple playthroughs may diminish your overall return and you may question how far your 60 bucks went when compared to a title like the witcher 3 or metal gear solid v.",

The Srorm island add on is fun but it also gets old pretty quick. Maybe if they do part 3 they can nail it since the next ps4 and Xbox one are fairly new. My advice would be make it arcade since the Forza series already has simulation to that fan base, in other words pick one hybrids never work because fans on both side will not be happy.",

I haven't used any other fight stick before, but the joystick has a little play and isn't stiff when centered.

You watch a couple youtube videos and proceed with caution, and you too can be an engineer (or at least feel like one for a day). I wont lie, this took me more than four hours total work time, but I was very deliberate and cautious-- I was really worried about damaging those tiny components.  After doing it, I feel like I could have worked with a heavier hand. The back of the unit comes without the black layer of what appears to be insulation and the front comes without the thin plastic frame you will need if you want the unit to fit as snugly as possible.  Both of these can be removed from the damaged unit with a little steam and a thin blade.  the screen protector they threw in was unnecessary; I spent a lot of time trying to apply it without airbubbles.  ultimately I just didnt use it since there wasnt one on my original anyway.",

         "Not sure what some of these reviewers are talking about, my wife got me this game for my b-day and will admit didn't play it until about a week later ( I was hesitant to even take the shrink wrap off ), but after installing it and playing the game I was pretty impressed with not only the graphics both cut scenes AND gameplay but the actual story was pretty engaging. I thought I'd never say that again after COD Modern Warfare, but it's true it's true! Gameplay was fun and almost fresh, almost, I really dug the exo suit abilities kinda like TitanFall minus giant robots but with an actual campaign. Controls are tight and responsive and the voice acting was better than I expected, so good in fact my wife actually sat and watched many of the cut scenes and she almost never does that for any game. To recap an immersive story, some of the best graphics on the Xbox 1, good controls, different abilities different feel thanks to the exo suits, good voice acting. Why then only four stars? well I'm glad you asked...I got through the campaign in about 7-8 hrs...on veteran, not too big of a deal i know cod games are all about the multiplayer but I have always played the main campaign before jumping into an online match and, this was one of the easiest campaigns to get through on veteran that I can remember take it as you will it is what it is. Installation although not really a part of the gameplay itself, It is part of the whole experience. Installation from a disc took ver 3 hours not cool, I realize its a large file almost 50 GBs, but come on over 3 hours really? not for a download but rather a simple installation, C'mon?<br />DISCLAIMER: This review is for the main campaign ONLY not the multiplayer. But I will add my two cents for those of you who trash the matchmaking cause you can't prey on the newer or lesser skilled players so you can bolster your stats are you serious!? are you serious!? shame on you, ya'll need to get a life. If you feel you are that good on ANYTHING in life, challenge yourself against like minded and similarly skilled competitors or opponents and stop bitchin' about not being able to take advantage of the COD skill impaired cause that ain't cool and you look petty and childish (unless of course you ARE a child), in which case I would suggest you put forth all that energy and effort on become a better human being rather that a better COD player, again just my two cents...Game on and prosperlife, challenge yourself against like minded and similarly skilled competitors or opponents and stop bitchin' about not being able to take advantage of the COD skill impaired cause that ain't cool and you look petty and childish (unless of course you ARE a child), in which case I would suggest you put forth all that energy and effort on become a better human being rather that a better COD player, again just my two cents...Game on and prosper",

The only downside is the fault of the Wii U itself, not the controller (you gotta keep the Gamepad on; turning it off means turning off the system).<br /><br />Definitely recommended if you're looking for a good, normal controller for the Wii U and don't want to spend too much.

         "The Witcher 3 is one of the best games that I have ever played. But first let's start with the major downside: bugs. The game is buggy, with some rare framerate issues, and as of writing this review there is at least one quest that is unfinishable because of a weird bug (Skellige's Most Wanted), but luckily CD Projekt Red is constantly releasing patches so soon the game will be perfect! Besides this though, I do consider this game perfect. The combat is amazing, and extremely fun, and although it is quite difficult in the beginning, it gets easier. I recommend playing on the &#34;Blood and Broken Bones&#34; difficulty. The graphics, although slightly glitchy at times, are beautiful. The world of the Witcher 3 is one of the most beautiful, and expansive that I have ever seen. This is my first Witcher game, and it is easy to get into, although I do recommend reading the books (I'm currently reading Time of Contempt) because not only are they great, but also will make your gameplay experience that much better. Overall, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is not only the current best game on the Playstation 4, but also one of the best games ever.",

The song selection is really pretty decent...I actually went and bought several of the songs I hadn't heard before because they were so good...especially Self Trap by Playground Kings.<br /><br />I should dock it a star because there a few bugs in the lessons and the Guitarcade but I won't because I have so much fun playing.  I don't want to stop.  I have downloaded a few songs (they are NOT cheap) and that has even extended the fun because I now get to play along with The Black Keys Gold on the Ceiling.<br /><br />If you want to learn guitar and don't want to waste money on private tutors early on just getting your fingers callused, this game will get you there and you won't want to stop.",

I still have to pair the recover and headphone about 8x throughout about 4-6 hrs of playing. If your playing multiplayer games it will mess you up. I don't review stuff often, but never bought somthing so &quot;Chinese&quot;<br /><br />EDIT: they now constantly have a problem. It's a problem that was once a week. Now it's all the time. You can play for 30min then the sounds goes completely hay wire. Sounds very very strange and hurts my ears. I had commented on it below. The robotic sounds. Very disappointed. I will never buy anything from turtle beach again they've sold their good name to the Chinese to maximize profits. Shame on them.<br /><br />they disconnect from sound completely and have to be re-paired very often. 2-3 times through 5hrs of playing.<br /><br />Every couple hours they will also sound like a really weird robot electronic sound. Very very strange sounding. Can't play a game at all with it when it does this. Hurts my ears. Again only way to fix is re-pair/sync them, but be prepared to do it often. Not reliable.<br /><br />Max Volume is okay, honestly I think it's 20% lower then my turtle beach X32. And they were as loud as I like anything. These will never hurt your ears on full blast by a long shot. They get loud enough to be okay, but not LOUD.<br /><br />The whole charging thing lol. Yeah they are constantly on when charging. No way to turn that off. Just turning them down is all. So if they are off and you plug them in to charge they will come on and stay on while charging.  Only thing you can do is turn volume down on them. That is a massive engineering mistake. Someone should have their rear end paddeled like a small toddler....then appropriately be fired.<br /><br />The presets are a joke. I mean a real joke. Like the designers were laughing when they saw them being put on a truck and being shipped out. All presets sound very very close tothe same.<br /><br />These are wireless. But holy cow, they suck besides that.<br /><br />If you were to ignore all the negatives (which are way too bad to really ignore... Seriously) they are a 3 out of 5 star headphone.<br /><br />These are cheap Chinese junk. Turtle beach is looking for maximum profits at the consumers expense. It's time to leave turtle beach where they belong. On the curb wearing useless headphones.<br /><br />They used to be pretty good. No more. They are trash.<br /><br />Update...... They just started flashing red and stopped working.... I'm actually not surprised at all. From the sounds of their customer service and warranty, I will be cutting my losses and throwing them away.",

Now I can put my hand up against the console and it is not hot at all, just slightly warm, which is to be expected for as many hours that it is being used daily.<br /><br />Having the console in the vertical stand also helps free up some space and clear up some of the clutter around the TV, which is nice. The unit charges the controllers quickly and easily as well, so it is nice to always have a freshly charged controller on hand. I received one to review, and everyone here loves it.

         "Fantastic game overall; if the &#34;Sonic Boom&#34; branding scares you, don't let it. This is one of the best Sonic outings in years.<br /><br />Sonic Boom is a GORGEOUS 2.5D entry in the series that pulls it's characters and settings from the Sonic Boom branch of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. That means it's a sidescroller like classic games, but with 3D graphics - think something like Donkey Kong Country Returns if you haven't heard of the term &#34;2.5D&#34; before. The title incorporates elements from a lot of quality sidescrollers - including world map screens similar to various Mario titles, team based gameplay with unique powers like in The Lost Vikings, expansive maps with hidden paths only accessible with specific skills a la Metroid - and meshes them all with quality Sonic gameplay.<br /><br />If you just play through the stages as fast as you can, you'll enjoy a Sonic game with great level designs that's a little less precise than the best games in the series, but has a focus on tricks & special moves to engage instead of asking for precision all the time. With the characters' new &#34;electro whip&#34; thingie, they can now swing from grapple points, and with their individual abilities, all the platforming becomes something special. You'll end up pulling off combos like run &#62; jump &#62; swing &#62; air dash &#62; slam down into a zip boost &#62; grind &#62; bounce pad &#62; swing, etc. So the classic-ness of the gameplay, while a little less fast and a little less precise, is actually a lot more engaging and rewarding to play. The game does bring the speed though, it's just metered out a little better than in previous sidescrollers. The camera is also a lot better and more dynamic, with a nice amount of &#34;lead space&#34; (the distance between the front of your character and the edge of the screen) so you actually have enough time to see obstacles coming and AVOID them. Crazy!<br /><br />The game is a bit of an &#34;adventure&#34; in that you'll need to return to areas with new characters to gain access to different chunks of the levels and collect different doodads. Collecting doodads is important for a few reasons, namely you need them to access new levels (they're locked and require a certain number of emblems - obtained by finishing the stage, finishing it under a certain amount of time, collecting all the crystal shards in the level, etc. - to unlock), and you need blueprints to get Tails to build you upgrades. These upgrades apply to all characters, and include awesome things like destroying enemies by running through them, revealing item locations on the level map, or adding a &#34;Ring Vaccuum&#34; effect to your character so you can grab them by merely getting close to them, instead of having to get through them. A fully powered up character at the end of the game is a big improvement from one at the beginning, so the upgrades are important. Luckily going back into the levels with new characters and using their abilities are really fun. Tails lets you use fans in the level since he can glide, and he also has a toy submarine that lets you access a mini-game to get things too. Knuckles and bust through certain materials and tunnel underground, and Sticks has a boomerang that you can control around in the air - very useful for anything really, but specifically for hitting switches and turning off traps. Our main man Sonic however can air dash, which gives him the ability to reach out of the way areas (&#34;L shaped&#34; moves; air dashing straight up and right, for instance) and bust through blue blocks. You'll see all these &#34;hooks&#34; while making your way through levels, so you're going to WANT to explore further. And with Tails' upgrades, you won't be wandering around aimlessly - you'll see the items on your level map, know where you need to go, and just have to find the way to get there and pick the character who can do it.<br /><br />The levels are really well designed in general, and - like I said before - gorgeous. This is one game where you'll want to crank the 3D up from time to time, because the depth in the game is really nice. There's a great mix of foreground, mid and background objects and the camera's dynamic; the 3D really makes it look like a diorama with it's mix of depth. All the models & textures look great too - this is one of the nicest looking games on 3DS for sure. It all moves at a smooth clip too. All the worlds are very distinct in aesthetic and feel from one another too. All the levels are built to accommodate both speeding through, with a default &#34;middle track&#34; and exploration, with additional &#34;upper and lower tracks&#34;, to every level. So you'll end up exploring above, below and all over your main track on subsequent playthroughs, but it's always off to the side the speedier stuff - it never gets in the way. They're really good level designs that they function so well just racing through or slowing down and taking your time.<br /><br />Sonic Shattered Crystal is super enjoyable once you come to terms with it's little oddities. Namely how progression works (gotta get those emblems!) and the less-precise-than-other-Sonic-sidescrollers controls (well, that's not true. It's better than Sonic 4 Part 1 and the Sonic Rivals games). It's gorgeous, the elements it adds to Sonic gameplay are fresh and welcome, the way it handles team based skills works beautifully, there's loads of content here, and it's just a blast to play. Highly recommended - but you don't even need to take my word for it. There's a demo for Sonic Boom on the 3DS eShop - just give it a play. This game is rad and deserves a purchase if you enjoy quality sidescrollers and Sonic games. Also, be on the lookout for it's sequel coming up this year: Sonic Boom Fire & Ice. It's from the same developers and looks to be as good as this one while adding in more to the formula.<br /><br />Fun fact; the developers of this are Sanzaru Games. They're also the studio that makes Sly Cooper for Sony now (Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time for PS3/Vita is freakin' fantastic as well, I should point out). Sony only deals in quality platformers - just look at Jak & Daxter, Ratchet & Clank or Ape Escape - so when Sega gets the makers of Sly Cooper to make a Sonic game, you would figure it would be good, right? Well it is. It's an absolute - baffling - shame that so many outlets refused to cover this and instead focus on the disaster of the console game.ike I said before - gorgeous.

That being said I came to Arkham City backtracking from the disappointment that was Arkham Orgins and this game feels fresh and brand new even though its been out for years. Game play is tough without being unforgiving and the story is really interesting. Im seriously considering buying DLC though thats a little pricey.",

         "I purchased this headset with the intent of using it with my PS4. A USB dongle is provided in box for pairing with the PS4, and it is stated that the mic will pair with other bluetooth devices without the dongle. This mic does in fact pair with the PS4 when the dongle is used, unlike what is stated in the other review.<br /><br />The problem is that the audio quality is terrible. I don't know whether this is due to the dongle doing a bad job at transmitting and receiving audio, or just the headset itself, but the quality is unbearable. The input/recording quality is pretty bad, but almost tolerable. The output/playback quality is potentially worse than what you would hear out of a cassette player that survived a nuclear fallout that's playing at the other end of a noisy tunnel. It's choppy, cuts in and out, and is just plain awful. Do yourself a favor and do not purchase this mic.<br /><br />Aside from the garbage audio quality, everything else seems OK. The build quality is decent, and it's generally pretty comfortable. It's a shame, I thought I could finally have a wireless chat headset for my PS4, but this one is a significant downgrade from the default mic provided with the PS4, and I'll be returning it.",

AI is horrific, you can execute an enemy next to another enemy and still not get noticed. The sound is below par, I mean it's like going back in time to older WWII shooters. Graphics are probably the worst I've seen to date for a shooter. Everything blends together so you have a terrible time finding enemies during a fight. The controls make you feel disconnected from the game, they are unresponsive, laggy when they do work, and clunky feeling. Game runs like garbage too, fps dips a lot, the entire UI is laggy too. The finished game actually feels like an alpha stage game. Stick away from this game, I don't know if I can finish it, it's pretty bad. Shame on the developers for releasing it this way. I gave it a 2 star because the game does play on the console and hasn't frozen or locked up on me yet.",

         "While Infinity 3.0 improves upon 2.0 in a number of ways: somewhat shorter load times (though still often close to 2 minutes long), better (though far from perfect) control of vehicles, the inclusion of Star Wars and loads of other content, there are some borderline game-breaking issues, some of which are inexcusable holdovers from 2.0.  Oh, and way too much Jar Jar Binks...<br /><br />If you don't want to read the full review, here's the executive summary:  1) You cannot play the play sets on line; 2) If you play split screen, player 2 will not earn in-game currency, will not earn achievements, will not unlock any of the toys or sidekicks, and will not level up their figure for when they go back to solo play; 3) The system of sharing of figures (i.e., between family members) is so convoluted that I've yet to find an explanation on Disney's site that is understandable; 4) This game is plagued with so many bugs/glitches that it's hard to play a session without encountering one.  The one I experience almost every time I play is the sound effects cutting out, but not the music, often requiring a restart of the game.<br /><br />Now the longer review...<br /><br />First, like Infinity 2.0, my son and I are unable to join each other's game via Xbox Live.  The invitee always gets dropped to the dashboard.  I went back and forth with Disney support on this with 2.0 and they told me that they were aware of the issue in 2.0 but that I should be confident that it would be fixed by 3.0.  It was not.  This game crashing also occurs in the Flynn's Arcade portion of the game and I've seen other users on Infinity forums say they also have this issue.  It seems to be an issue with both the router/modem used by Comcast and the one used by AT&T U-Verse.<br /><br />The really sad thing is that even if we were able to connect, we wouldn't be able to play the campaign / play sets together over Xbox Live anyway.  Yep, you read that right -- the story mode &#34;play sets&#34;, like the Star Wars campaign that comes with this game, cannot be played over Xbox Live.  If you want to play with a friend, you have to play split screen.  I'm not sure if the upcoming expansions for Toybox Takeover and Toybox Speedway will support online play or only split screen.<br /><br />So we play it split screen -- which brings us to our next issues.  Whoever is playing as the 2nd player does not get any credit for the sparks (the game's currency for purchasing items in the toybox mode) he collects.  My son had 307 sparks when he and I started a session, and though it read over 4000 after we played a few missions, it was back to 307 when he fired up a single player session.  Worse than this, though, is that he didn't get any of his character leveling progress.  Also, player 2 cannot earn achievements in split screen.  Oh, and any toys or sidekicks that either player in split screen unlocks only go to player 1.  Player 2 is relegated to &#34;tag along&#34; status.<br /><br />Why on earth would anyone want to play as player 2 if they aren't going to get in game currency, toys or have their character level up?!?<br /><br />For a game that clearly seems to have a community and family focus, the inability to get a multiplayer game to function properly baffles me.  Furthermore, as a game clearly geared toward kids (and kids at heart), there are some enormously frustrating platforming portions of this game.  My 15 year old son, who is no slouch at gaming, said, &#34;I have no idea how Disney expects an 8 year old to be able to complete this&#34; during one mission where we both died so many times we were ready to give up.<br /><br />Also, if you are annoyed by Jar Jar Binks -- and who in their right mind isn't? -- there's about 20 minutes of the Twilight of the Republic play set that will have you ready to throw your controller at the screen.  I truly cannot fathom why Disney would interject such a huge dose of Jar Jar into this game.  It is worse than the movies.  Seriously.<br /><br />If Disney fixes the multiplayer issues and cleans up the numerous bugs, this turns into a solid 5-star game for me.  Really, there is such an amazing amount of content and creativity in this game, it's a shame to see it hobbled by the issues above.  That's what makes all of this so sad -- this game truly has the potential to be absolutely amazing, but instead it just leaves me shaking my head in disappointment.<br /><br />I will say that Disney's tech support, despite being unable to solve my son's and my inability to play a game over Xbox Live, have been very pleasant and prompt in replying to me.  Unfortunately, I've about hit my frustration threshold with this game and am ready to throw in the towel.r /><br />If Disney fixes the multiplayer issues and cleans up the numerous bugs, this turns into a solid 5-star game for me.

I love the whole atmosphere of the game and the creation aspect since you can do pretty much anything you want to do.<br /><br />If you have a Disney Infinity game already then I suggest not upgrading to 3.0 until you get a next gen console. This game is getting quite big and if you want to build bigger worlds and enjoy smoother gameplay then get it when you get a next gen console. This upcoming black friday would be a great time since this game would probably drop a lot and so will consoles.",

Maybe I was getting lag from plugging this into a hub, but it just worked better overall with the adapter.<br />Buttons are okay. They respond well enough, but don't have a lot of tactile feedback. The stick has too much play, but simple tape remedies this easily. That's the only mod I've felt the need to do on this joystick: it's otherwise a competent entry-level stick that will keep you in good gaming times for a while. An octagonal restrictor, or at least something better than that dumb plastic washer, wouldn't hurt...<br />I've won records in games like Super Crate Box and Blazblue using this stick, which to me means that it works well and quickly, without introducing any serious lag.<br />You can do a lot better for a lot more money/work, or you can do a lot worse for about the same price. I don't know of any other good mid-/entry-level sticks that are still commonly available. Of those that are, most seem to be for the PS2, so again, if you want this sort of thing for PC gaming, I recommend a USB adapter over whatever firmware is built into these things. It sounds backwards, but the button mappings differ between consoles and the adapter helps with that.",

I have done hours of research and it turns out I can only record a select few non desirable shows with my Xbox. The game play is not any better than my friends PS4, the user interface is designed to get you to spend money and not to have fun and be entertained. Which is why I obviously bought the thing. Very limited instructions on how to use It with cable box. Microsoft is not what it used to be. Buying a PS4 today cus Xbox is a scam and is just frustrating.",

         "I love this game.  This game delivers so much suspense on different levels.  Not only do you have to have quick reflexes to survive, you have to carefully consider the decisions you make.  The game seems like it can go a lot of different directions so the replay value is there.  Gorgeous graphics and great cut scenes.  I really enjoy the diversity in the characters and i found myself really caring what happens to each of them, all but one anyway.  The only thing that turned me off from the game at first was the wonky camera angles, but you get used to it and I think it does make things more cinematic and suspenseful at times.  All in all the Butterfly system, storyline, characters, and action sequences made up for the lack of control in camera viewpoints and character movement, so if this bugs you at first as it did me, give the game a chance.",

         "I've been testing the PDP AG7 True Wireless Headset for Xbox One for a few weeks. The first truly wireless headset that I've seen, the PDP AG7 is comfortable -- even with my large head. All of the other Xbox One headsets I've tested have a wire for chat that runs from the headphones to your controller. Not the PDP AG7. The key is in the clever USB transmitter that plugs into the Xbox. It connects automatically so you don't have to struggle with those awkward BlueTooth connection processes.<br /><br />One feature I especially LOVE is the separate dials for Chat and overall game volume. No more messing about with the plus or minus tabs trying to strike a balance. The PDP AG7 gives you the control to dial down (or up) chat with a dial. The same with game volume.<br /><br />The overall sound during gameplay is amazing. I can now hear when enemies are behind, to the left or right -- or above me in games like Titanfall. LOVE the sound.<br /><br />The on/off button is on the outside of the left hear piece. Just tap during game play to mute your microphone.<br /><br />The only ding for the PDP AG7 is that the mic is way too sensitive. It picks up everything -- the ceiling fan included in my case. I wish the mic were only calibrated to picking up your voice. Not a huge deal but annoying. Also, when you mute yourself the tip of the microphone (which is blue or red (extra bass)) flashes periodically to let you know you're on mute. I could see it out of the corned or my left eye (even when retracted) so I put a little piece of duct tape on it. Problem solved.<br /><br />Overall though this is by far the best headset for Xbox One I've come across. Comfortable. Excellent sound -- and truly wireless. Two thumbs up for the  PDP AG7!",

         "I have never played Disney Infinity 1.0 or 2.0 so I am basing this on my experience with 3.0 so far. First off, the base is well made and looks good on a table. The characters are incredibly detailed and are worth it even if you don't own Disney Infinity. You can set the difficulty of the game so kids and adults can enjoy it. I love the whole atmosphere of the game and the creation aspect since you can do pretty much anything you want to do.<br /><br />The reason I dropped this to four stars was because 3 Hours into the game I was editing a home in split screen when the PS4 told me that the game save had become corrupted and everything was deleted which is quite unfortunate. The levels of the characters stay in tact but I still loose all progress made in the game and I have no idea why it happened. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. If you have kids or are a star wars/disney fan then I highly recommend this game, it's just a fun time!<br /><br />Update 8/30<br />It happened again, it appears to be a bug when you add a room in certain places in your INterior so I would recommend that you don't do much in your INterior until Disney sends out an update to patch the bug.<br /><br />Update 8/31<br />It happened again during a toy box build when putting just a few things down. This time it didn't erase all the game save, if this happens to you then don't close the game/app. Just hit continue and get back to the main menu so you start from your last checkpoint, hopefully they fix this soon since it is a bit inconvenient.",

You can easily take it off and put it on another controller but I just wanted more convient and to have a back up. Overall I do love the product, but it can fall off somewhat easily i.e. if you drop your controller, so be careful. I bought this bundle just in case I lose it because it did fall off several times and once you get use to how it feels, its hard to go back to the original controller. I feel naked without it. I wish it was all black too so it match my controller but on the other hand I have black carpet so its hard to find it if it drops. 4 stars because it needs variety of colors and it falls off easily sometimes (maybe glue might work).",

The characters are incredibly detailed and are worth it even if you don't own Disney Infinity. You can set the difficulty of the game so kids and adults can enjoy it. I love the whole atmosphere of the game and the creation aspect since you can do pretty much anything you want to do. Also, watch out because this game gets incredibly expensive really quickly. While all of the new characters look cool, I suggest you check to make sure the character is also good in game since some of them don't have great abilities nor skill trees.",

         "The PGA Tour competition is way to hard for medium difficulty and shots from the medium rough.  I found that the player has to score 15 to 20 under par to win (this is for a round of 4).  From watching the PGA Tour on TV,  most of the pros can win with 10 to 15  under par for the 4-round tournament.  Also, using the analog sticks to hit the ball proved exceedingly difficult.  I do not intend to spend 100 hours of practice to use the analog sticks.  What saved the game for me was the option to use the Swing meter get much better consistency of a golf shot than using the analog sticks.  Also, the unlocking of Pro Shop items and cover stories was confusing.  I was hoping that as I got better, more golf courses would be unlocked, but I did not notice that.  Same thing for items in the Pro Shop.  I played the game for a long time, but I seem to have reached a static point where no other items are unlocked.",

My hands are average, not large (yes, I checked) and palming this with the rearmost part of it actually touching my palm (you know, palm-grip - the very comfortable way of making the mouse support your hand and not the other way around, with the round part that fits exactly into the lower region of one's palm being in the lower region of one's palm) means my fingers overshoot the tip by almost an inch on the middle finger, so I am forced to either use a claw grip or a fingertip one.\\<br /><br />Also, the finish very clearly marks with grease from the fingers, and doesn't clean particularly well for being sanded plastic.",

         "Driveclub is definitely a good game. I can say that is true but it is not perfect. It also has it's flaws which at times really can be upsetting.  First let me try to explain why i think this is a good game. I think the first thing i noticed when i popped the disc in and loaded it up was the Graphics. They are truly representative of the ps4 potential. The graphics are top notch. The cars all look beautiful, the weather, the sun and lighting effects are all realistic. You can change the time of day in most races and if u happen to be driving while the sun is setting... Well you're gona have a bad time because the sun will be blinding. But at the same time thats pretty darn impressive.  Another thing this game has going for it is the simplified/stripped down approach to racing. No silly story here. In fact right after the loading screen, you are put behind the wheel of a Mercedez Bens AMG. Not even a tutorial if i remember correctly. But thats what i like! Thats what i expect from a racing simulator. No silly story that doesnt make sense. No annoying anouncer telling you to slow down on your turns. Nothing. Heck not even a soundtrack unless you change the default settings and turn the voulume up from its original 0% it's meant to be all driving and focus on the sounds of the cars.  Ah yes the cars.. This topic is somewhat difficult.  Yes we already established that they look good, they sound good... But do they handle? Well see here's where driveclub can become an issue if you dont know what it's trying to acomplish. This game is a pure racing simulator. No forgivness. No rewind no nothing. So yeah the cars will perform as they're supposed to. Dont expect a Hyper car to handle all fine and dandy when your going 180+ mph. They all have a unique handling.and especially so depending on the weather condition. If its raining and you're in that rwd car haulling ass... Forget it. You're toast. All the cars required me to do a practice run and then go for the real race.... And i would still come out 5th place. This also has to do with the AI which is yet another thing that grinds my gears when playing this game. Just picture them as beyond professional. They are not intimidated by you and they follow a perfect line all through the track. Im serious this game will require multiple runs through an event. But yet it is still fun. Because it's really satisfying to fail a couple of times and then finally get in the zone and come out on top. Truly satisfying.  Just be prepared. This is no need for speed.  Ah yes now is everything all worth the pricetag? Well.. I would say it depends. I spent about 25 bucks. Amazon at the time that i am writing this is out of stock but that doesnt mean you cant price match it at a store! Thats what i did. I showed em the 25 dollar price. And they matched amazon. However apart from That i spent another 25 for the season pass which is the cheapest method to obtain ALL the dlc and extra cars. Without the dlc you miss out on a ton of stuff. So if u plan on playing this without the dlc then i would say its not worth it. You will be missing out on a lot.  But for 50 bucks total spent. Im really enjoying this game.  So here's a basic good/bad summary of the game  GOOD: Visuals, Sound, weather effect, simplified racing approach, cars are demanding yet rewarding to drive  Bad: AI will have you beat often. No ability to change AI Dificulty, incomplete roster of cars/events if you dont purchase season pass DLC. Does this game require patience? Yes.",

There were a few scratches on the top of the set but that was a possibility as it is a refurbished item. Everything seems to be working well as i have not run into any issues. I haven't tried the headphones yet but the controller and everything else works fine. I would have given it five stars if it wasn't for my disappointment of thinking a set of games came with it from the card i received with it only to find out that it should have been tossed when they did the refurb. One of the two codes worked so i did get one of the games...too bad i already had it on the ps3 lol. Overall a good deal and would do it again if needed.",

We did not want the clutter or the risk of chewed cables by charging our controllers with USB cables.  This dock works great.  The design is self-centering.  The key is to place the controller in the cradle and let it rest which perfectly centers the controller in the cradle.  Then press down on top of the controller to activate the spring loaded charging cradle.  When it is time to remove the controller, press down on top of the controller to deactivate the spring loaded charging cradle and then remove the controller.<br /><br />It would be easy to try and insert and later remove the controller as a single motion but you might not get the flawless action that way -and may risk damage to your controller or the charger.  I think some of the bad reviews are from people attempting this instead of the two-step method of first letting the controller rest in the cradle and then pressing down to activate the charger.<br /><br />One of the best features of this unit is it does not use the front USB ports of the PS4.  This is a deal breaker of other charger designs when you need to use the PS4 USB ports for other things like the wireless headset dongles.",

The characters are incredibly detailed and are worth it even if you don't own Disney Infinity. You can set the difficulty of the game so kids and adults can enjoy it. I love the whole atmosphere of the game and the creation aspect since you can do pretty much anything you want to do. \\<br /><br />If you're contemplating getting this then just do it. If you have 1.0 or 2.0 and want to upgrade then I'm not sure if it's worth it since I have never played them, from what I have hear you can use your 2.0 base and only buy the 3.0 game but don't quote me on that.",

         "Hello out there & welcome to this. This is going to be a review for X Men VS Street Fighter on The Sega Saturn. This was the home version of X Men VS Street Fighter to have & I'm not the only who believe's that. This game is loads of fun & The Saturn shows off how good the backgrounds look it's pretty much the arcade so the backgrounds look like a comic book the animations are all there & you can team up 2 characters like in The Arcade & Tag them in & out which The Playstation didn't have & having that was a big selling point. This game went on to have Marvel Superheroes vs Street Fighter & 3 Marvel vs Capcom games. The Street Fighter characters look like they do in The Alpha series. The X Men characters look like they do from the animated series from the early to late 90's. You have Ryu, Ken, Akuma or Gouki in The Japanese version. Charlie Chun Li, Cammy M Bison or Vega as he's called in The Japanese version. Zangief Dhalsim on The Street Fighter side. On The X Men side you have Magneto, Sabertooth, Juggernaut, Cyclops, Wolverine, Gambit, Rouge & Storm. There's really no story in this game only you team up 2 fighter fighter through 6 battles then fight Apocalypse in weird boss battle & whoever dealt the final blow to Apocalypse then you fight your partner at the end of the game. I know I make this sound uninteresting but this is an excellent game. The control's are great the gameplay is fun there is some replay value. The graphics are really good. If you have MAME there's no reason not to play this if you have a Saturn & an Action 4 In 1 Cart it is pricey however it won't break the bank like with Guardian Heroes or Street Fighter Zero 3. So my next review will be for Street Fighter Zero 3 imo the best version of the game.",

         "I'm a fan of AC and I've played every game until 100% completion (or close to it). That is until I got Unity.  Like many AC fanboys, I got this game out of sheer loyalty to the series, and the only thing I feel good about is that I didn't pay the full price for it.  Even getting it at $20 is still much, because then you have the problem of slogging through this beast of a game.  First off, this game is massive, and not in a good way.  Oddly enough the campaign is the shortest of any of the AC games, and just as forgettable.  What is amazing is the insane amount of side quests you are given to play.  That would be cool if they where all fun, but a lot of them are like just going though the motions.  There are 30 &#34;companion missions&#34; where all you do is run a ways and then just kill some random dude.  Such fun.  Some of them are interesting like the murder mysteries, but most of them are a chore to play.  Side missions should be what they are, not 80% of the freaking game!  You can do Co-op missions, and they are okay, if you actually get paired with someone doesn't run off and let you do all of the fighting.  Even after all of the patches, I still get game crashes, character freeze ups, and wonky controls.  The controls feel the worst of any AC game.  Trying to navigate Arno in stealth positions is annoying to say the least, and negates the best thing AC had to offer, and that was stealth play.  In this game you move a little bit, get spotted and just slug it out 8 dudes.  Seriously, that's the game.  The graphics where outstanding, you could easily fall in love with moving about the city.  Also, the customizing Arno was the best part of the game.  All of the color options, and trying on different parts of armor kept this game tolerable.  I really liked the detail in the belts, braces, hoods etc.  I don't recommend putting any more than 20-25 hours into this game.  I finished the campaign, about 50% of the side missions, and just said screw it.  This game showed to me that the series has officially run it's course.  A real shame, because this was a good series, but this is what happens when greedy game companies have to shell out half-assed games every year, instead of 2-3 years.  It's because fanboys like me will still by games out of loyalty.  Well no more.",

I've also used this with drive club on PS4 and Gran tourismo on PS3, but the FFB is not near as strong with those games.<br /><br />Only complaint-the FFB weakens when the wheel gets hot (known issue) which is noticeable during longer races.  Once it cools down, the strength comes back.  Overall, very happy with the wheel.",

I don't think it's the cables fault but I do feel the seller should have a notice listed in the item description that some games simply cannot be displayed through composite cables on some HDTVs. All of my other games worked and booted first try with coaxial adapter. For some reason (without getting into detail) some n64 games will not display over composite due to their resolution and the displays upscailing capabilities (or lack thereof).<br /><br />3. I didn't give it a 1 star because it did display my GameCube boot screen on my TV without issue (haven't tried any gcn games because I have no cube controller) but it at the very least work for one console I intend to start playing again!<br /><br />If it Would have worked as I thought it would with my TV I would say that, because of the price and prime shipping, it is a four star item.",

But that does not mean it is bad.<br /><br />I get the feeling folks were disappointed in this game because earlier games in the series were so highly rated.  But this is my first Thief game so I had no expectations.  Got the game free with &#34;games with gold&#34; promotion.<br /><br />Graphics and framerate are technically good.  Artistically I disliked the lack of colors, which is a typical problem with games running the Unreal engine.  Other complaints about the graphics: lots of load screens moving through the city, textures take time to load, self shadows are poorly done.  Still, overall above average.  And I think stable framerates really help playability in fps games.<br /><br />I like sneaking games like Splinter Cell, Hitman, and Metal Gear Solid.  This game plays in a similar fashion, even if it is not in the same league as those 3.  Downside is that combat is not a viable option unlike in those other games.  Sniping with the bow works fine though.<br /><br />Exploring the city is one of the best parts of the game.  There are lots of collectibles and side missions to do.  This game should keep you occupied for quite a while (unless you get bored).<br /><br />Story was not compelling, nor were the characters.  I did find some bugs with characters speaking and subtitles sometimes not happening at the right time.<br /><br />Overall, an average game.  Nothing horrible about it, but lots of little things wrong with it.  Best for gamers who like sneaking games.  Probably worth it at a heavily discounted price (say, under $10).",

         "My reviews are mainly focused on core gameplay mechanics, so that'll be my focus here.  For the longest time, I've been saying that Madden needs a definitive turnkey/pivotal title that'll be the true platform to continuously build the game up from.  Madden 16 to me is definitely that benchmark title as the feel of football is true and completely undeniable regarding what's going on here for sure.  Let me get into this a bit deeper.<br /><br />WR/DB Interactions: Out the box, you had a good number of people on the EA access 10 hour trial screaming out how catching was OP (overpowered), and were getting caught over end over end on deep balls in 1 v 1 situations mainly.  That's just the issue there though, people needed to learn how to use the new in game mechanics.  The days of just pressing Y or Triangle are gone.  You must learn to press A or X and play the receiver, spotlight the receiver if your secondary isn't great, assign the extra man or adjust your playcalling to have that safety over top to defend those situations just like they do IN REAL LIFE!!  There's only a few DBs/Safeties in the league that are great 1 on 1 defenders, and even they get additional support as they'll get beat too (ex: Patrick Peterson vs Amari Cooper is a great example of this).  If there were anything I'd say was an issue with this, it would be the frequency of one handed catches that would need to be toned down a bit.  Otherwise, I strongly suggest people get in the skills trainer and practice field and learn how to effectively use the mechanics instead of making the blind complaints because you're not winning like you were used to back then.  Times are changing for real now!!!<br /><br />QB Pass Placement/Inaccuracies/AI: In Madden 15 the pass innacuracies were introduced, but due to community complaints, it was toned down and the &#34;Robo QB&#34; was back in full effect.  This year it's back and not going anywhere.  In addition to dedicated pass placement mechanics, you have the most control since the PS2 days when it comes to how you want to deliver the ball, high over the shoulder lobs, mid-level passes that'll sail over LBs and in that hole within the zone where only the receiver can get it, or throwing it low and away so the risk of a pick on that curl or comeback route is reduced to nil and would only be a drop or a breakup by defender contact.  Now you can clearly see the CPU AI difference between Geno Smith and Tom Brady when it comes to how they are at making reads, accuracy on throws, and how they also deal with defensive pressure when the pocket collapses.<br /><br />Run Game/Trenches: Regarding the running game this year, the controlled player movement is greatly improved, as the ballcarrier feels much more weighed down and attached to the field.  Especially when it comes to making quick cuts, and bursting through holes, even when utilizing skill moves too, the footwork is highly noticeable and the player movement is the best out of ANY football game out in my opinion.  When it comes to the run game and reading blocks, you MUST BE PATIENT!!  You have to allow the blocks to develop and make the proper reads instead of mashing turbo and getting stuffed prematurely.  Speaking on the Trenches the O-Line/D-Line battling is much more balanced and the sack totals aren't nearly where they were in the history of the franchise.  Now it's more of a progressive win/loss battle to get into the backfield, unless you have a beast like JJ Watt/Gerald McCoy/Ndamukong Suh on the line you're controlling.  Even with that in place, with the CPU QB AI, they don't hold the ball nearly as much as they used to and will already have made their read and threw the ball, or will try to buy time by moving in or rolling out the pocket and throwing the ball away.<br /><br />Penalties: The final part to discuss here are the penalties, they're FINALLY back and count more than a way of impacting how gameplay outcomes are potentially determined like in years past.  Now the sliders determine the frequency of what penalties get called.  What I like even more is that when the penalties are called, there are clear animations to show what had happened onfield.  Whether it's a holding, PI, facemask or an illegal block in the back, they all have a visual depiction to go along with what penalty took place.  They still are lacking every penalty legible for the game at this point, and also a challenge system a la NFL 2K5 where I can choose what I want to challenge regardless of what took place on the field instead of the game dictating what can or can't be challenged.  Once again, this is a legit foundation to build upward from.<br /><br />In closing, these gameplay refinements make this the most realistic playing Madden title to date, and these past 3 games (Madden 13 - 15) were the building blocks that helped 16 set itself up to truly be great going forward.  With some tuning/patching within these core gameplay aspects.  Madden 16 can be a truly official title to set the tone of true football authenticity and replication for the future of this franchise.",

Used copies do not contain said code on the back of the users manual. Gameplay is good clean fun. Multitude of weapons from the warhammer40k universe. Some of the best customization features in PVP.

The problem with DS2 on last generation hardware was that they were hitting the ceiling in terms of what they could do to top the original Dark Souls from simple animations to challenges. This PS4 port...well, port would be an insulting term--blows away its last gen counterpart. If it's your first time playing, you're in for danger. If you're a last gen vet, take all your pre-existing knowledge of each area and chuck it in the garbage. The enemy placement has been remixed and rebalanced. I feel that's a great bonus to the vets because the experience is still going to be grueling and fresh. Environmental details are vastly improved. Light shines bright, fog and mist are impenetrable, and darkness is oppressive. You can make out the careful detail of the Tseldora Cove spiders, Alonne knights are more ninja like in their ambushes and appearances. The dark orb hurling giants of Harvest Valley can now target you upwardly on the cliff at the beginning, so be more tactful on the arrow sniping.<br /><br />From Software did a wonderful job and I view this as the true vision of Dark Souls 2 made real.",

Back with my PS3, I had purchased a charging deck ([[ASIN:B00HGSLCTW New USB Charge Double Deck for PS3 Dual Shock Controller Charger]]) that required you to perfectly position the controllers into the slots so they would plug into the mini usb inputs.  While not being difficult to do, this sometimes took more time than it should because there was NO margin for error.  THIS charger uses the &#34;headphone&#34; input and simply requires you to rest the controller on the deck and &#34;click&#34; in down into place.  Simple as can be and I believe this will add to the life of controllers!  Couldn't be happier!",
